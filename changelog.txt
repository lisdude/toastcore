[$edit_state] Add $edit_state for editor state storage.
[$player.inline_editor_options] To store inline editor options.

[$string_utils:fit_to_screen, $string_utils:adjust_column_lengths, $string_utils:neat] Programmatically produce nicely aligned columns with headers.

[#0:do_login_command] Call connection_name_lookup to do DNS name resolution in a threaded task (thereby preventing the server from blocking on a bad lookup). Since name lookup suspends, also replace 'return <obj>' calls with switch_player.
