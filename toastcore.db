Implementation notes
2
--------------------
2
Each biglist is actually a tree (a kind of B-tree, actually).
2
The routines above pass around handles of the form
2

2
    {root_node, size, leftmost_ord}
2

2
where root_node is the (string) name of a property that holds the root of the tree, size is the number of leaves in the tree, and leftmost_ord is the :_ord value of the leftmost element of the list (i.e., the leftmost leaf).
2
Each node property has a value of the form 
2

2
    {height,list of subtrees}.
2

2
where the each of the subtrees is itself a 3-element list as above unless
2
the height is 0, in which case the subtrees are actually biglist elements of the arbitrary form determined by the home object.
2
At every level, each node except the rightmost has between this.maxfanout/2 and this.maxfanout subtrees; the rightmost is allowed to have as few as 1 subtree.

Generic BigList Utilities
2
----------------------------
2
This is a package for maintaining huge persistent (sorted) lists in a format that is less likely to spam the server (which runs into a certain amount of trouble dealing with long ordinary lists --- btw we use `biglist' to refer to the huge data structure we're about to describe and `list' to refer to ordinary MOO lists {...}).  The biglist in question lives on a particular object, to which we will refer in the discussion below as the `home' object, and its various elements appear as leaves of a tree whose nodes are kept in properties of the home object.  It should be noted that the home object does not need to be (and in fact should *not* be) a descendant of this one; this object merely provides utilities for manipulating the properties on the home object that are used in a particular biglist manipulation.  
2

2
All of the utilities below refer to `caller' to locate the home object.  Thus verbs to manipulate a given biglist must be located on or inherited by its home object itself.  The home object needs to define the following verbs
2

2
  :_make(@args)     => new property on home object with value args
2
  :_kill(prop)      delete a given property that was created by :_make
2
  :_get(prop)       => home.prop
2
  :_put(prop,@args) set home.prop = args
2
  :_ord(element)    given something that is of the form of a biglist element
2
                    return the corresponding ordinal (for sorting purposes).
2
                    If you never intend to use :find_ord, then this can be a 
2
                    routine that always returns 0 or some other random value.
2

2
See #5546 (Generic Biglist Resident) or $big_mail_recipient
2
for examples.
2

2
Those of the following routines that take a biglist argument are expecting
2
either {} (empty biglist) or some biglist returned by one of the other routines
2

2
  :length(biglist)          => length(biglist) (i.e., number of elements)
2
  :find_nth(biglist,n)      => biglist[n]
2
  :find_ord(biglist,k,comp) => n where n is
2
     the largest such that home:(comp)(k,home:_ord(biglist[n])) is false, or
2
     the smallest such that home:(comp)(k,home:_ord(biglist[n+1])) is true.
2
     Always returns a value between 0 and length(biglist) inclusive.
2
     This assumes biglist to be sorted in order of increasing :_ord values 
2
     with respect to home:(comp)().
2
     Standard situation is :_ord returns a number and comp is a < verb.
2

2
  :start(biglist,s,e)  => {biglist[s..?],@handle} or {}
2
  :next(@handle)       => {biglist[?+1..??],@newhandle} or {}
2
     These two are used for iterating over a range of elements of a biglist
2
     The canonical incantation for doing
2
        for elt in (biglist[first..last])
2
          ...
2
        endfor
2
     is
2
        handle = :start(biglist,first,last);
2
        while(handle)
2
          for elt in (handle[1])
2
            ...
2
          endfor
2
          handle = :next(@listdelete(handle,1));
2
        endwhile
2

2
The following all destructively modify their biglist argument(s) L (and M).
2

2
  :set_nth(L,n,value)  =>  L[n] = value
2
     replaces the indicated element
2

2
  :insert_before(L,M,n) => {@L[1..n-1],@M,@L[n..length(L)]}
2
  :insert_after (L,M,n) => {@L[1..n],  @M,@L[n+1..length(L)]}
2
     takes two distinct biglists, inserts one into the other at the given point
2
     returns the resulting consolidated biglist
2

2
  :extract_range(L,m,n) => {{@L[1..m-1],@L[n+1..]}, L[m..n]} 
2
     breaks the given biglist into two distinct biglists.
2

2
  :delete_range(L,m,n[,leafkiller]) => {@L[1..m-1],@L[n+1..]}
2
  :keep_range  (L,m,n[,leafkiller]) => L[m..n]
2
     like extract_range only we destroy what we don't want.
2

2
  :insertlast(L,value)  => {@L,value}
2
     inserts a new element at the end of biglist.  
2
     If find_ord is to continue to work properly, it is assumed that the 
2
     home:_ord(elt) is greater (comp-wise) than all of the :_ord values
2
     of elements currently in the biglist.
2

2
  :kill(L[,leafkiller]) 
2
     destroys all nodes used by biglist.  
2
     Calls home:leafkiller on each element.

Generic Large Capacity Mail Recipient
2
-------------------------------------
2
Since any modifications to large lists entail copying the entire list over, operations on ordinary mail recipients having large numbers of messages, that actually change the content of .messages will take inordinately long.  Thus we have this version which makes use of the $biglist package, scattering the messages onto numerous properties so that write operations involving only a few messages will not require recopying of the entire list.
2

2
In nearly all respects it behaves as the ordinary Mail Recipient, except that it is faster for certain kinds of operations.
2

2
Certain unimplemented verbs, like :date_sort(), and :messages() currently return E_VERBNF.
2

2
To convert an existing $mail_recipient-child (call it #MR) into a $big_mail_recipient-child the basic procedure is
2

2
    ;;something.foo= #MR:messages();
2
    @rmm 1-$ from #MR
2
    @unrmm expunge
2
    @chparent #MR to $big_mail_recipient
2
    ;#MR:receive_batch(@something.foo);
2

2
Reconstructing Damaged Big Mail Recipients
2
------------------------------------------
2
On rare occasions, the tree structure created by $biglist can be corrupted (this can happen on lists sufficiently large that a list-modification operation (e.g., @rmm, @renumber) runs out of ticks/seconds).  In the vast majority of such cases, your messages are all still there; it's simply that the tree we use for finding/searching them is messed up.
2

2
To recover messages from a damaged big mail recipient (#DBMR)
2
 --- read to the end before you start typing any commands ---
2

2
create a fresh $big_mail_recipient (#NEWBMR) and then do the following:
2

2
   ;#NEWBMR:restore_from(#DBMR)
2

2
When this finishes, #NEWBMR will contain all of the mail messages we were able to find.  (note that this will include messages that you had deleted from #DBMR but not expunged).  #NEWMBR should thenceforth be useable in place of #DBMR, however if #DBMR contains custom verbs and non-clear properties, these will also need to be copied over.
2

2
Alternatively, one may do
2

2
   @copyobject #DBMR to #TEMPBMR
2
   ;#DBMR:restore_from(#TEMPBMR)
2

2
to rebuild #DBMR in place.  This, however, will take about twice as long.
2

2
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2
WARNING!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!
2
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
2

2
Calling #OBJ:restore_from(...) COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY REMOVES ALL MESSAGES from the object that it is run on (#OBJ); you MUST be sure to EITHER have made a copy of #OBJ OR be doing the restore to a DIFFERENT object.

This is not a help database in the same way that children of $generic_help are. This object does the work when someone calls help in this way:
2

2
    help <object>:<verb>
2

2
It parses out the object and verb reference, pulls out the comments at the beginning of the verb, and returns them to the help system for nice display.
2

2
    :find_topics(string)
2
       tries to pull out an object:verb reference from string
2
       returns {string} if successful
2
       returns {} if not
2

2
    :get_topic(string)
2
       tries to pull out an object:verb reference from string (returns 0 if
2
          it fails to do so)
2
       tries to match the object
2
       checks the object to see if the verb exists
2
       pulls out the initial comments from the verb if they exist
2
       returns a meaningful list of strings to be displayed to the player
2

2
    :dump_topic(string)
2
       does the same as :get_topic above, but returns the verb documentation
2
          in dump form.

2
------
2
This object manages command parsing for unconnected players and governs the initiation of an actual connection.  There are verbs pertaining to registration, controlling player creation, and doing site-locks (see `help blacklist' on $wiz_help).
2

2
COMMANDS FOR UNCONNECTED PLAYERS
2

2
Recall that for each line that an unconnected player types, the server parses that line into words (the same way normal commands are parsed into a list of words that is then assigned to `args') and then #0:do_login_command is called.
2

2
  :parse_command (@args) => {verb, @args}
2
    given the sequence of arguments that were fed to #0:do_login_command
2
    this returns the name of a verb on $login to be called together with a 
2
    list of arguments to be passed to it.
2

2
By default this just returns args iff args[1] names an actual verb on $login that is +x and has args {"any","none","any"}.  Otherwise, it returns one of
2

2
  .blank_command   -- verb to call if command line is empty
2
  .bogus_command   -- verb to call if command line otherwise unintelligible
2

2
In both cases :parse_command returns a verbname followed by the entire args list passed to it (including the would-be verb at the beginning if any).
2

2
Currently the following verbs are available to non-connected players
2

2
  h*elp @h*elp       -- print .welcome_message
2
  ?                  -- print a short list of available commands
2
  w*ho @w*ho         -- print a list of logged in players (excluding wizards)
2
  co*nnect @co*nnect -- connect to an existing player
2
  cr*eate @cr*eate   -- create a new player
2
  up*time @up*time   -- tell how long the server has been running
2
  version @version   -- tell which version of the server is running
2
  q*uit @q*uit       -- logoff
2

2
Adding a new command is fairly straightforward; just create a verb on $login, making sure a previous verb doesn't already match the name you want to give it.  Then give it args of "any" "none "any" and make sure it is +x.  Such a verb should begin with `if (caller != #0) return E_PERM; ...' so as to prevent anyone other from a not-logged-in player from making use of it.
2

2
CUSTOMIZATIONS
2

2
  .welcome_message 
2
    -- the message for "help" to print.
2
  .create_enabled 
2
    == 0 => @create prints .registration_string if one tries to use it
2
    == 1 => anyone from a non-blacklisted site (see `help blacklist')
2
            may use @create to make a new player
2

2
  .registration_address
2
    -- an email address for character creation requests
2
  .registration_string  
2
    -- string to print to players to give them information about how to get 
2
       a character created for them, .registration_address is substituted 
2
       for %e, % for %%
2
  .newt_registration_string
2
    -- string to print to @newted players (see `help @newt').
2
       same substitutions as for .registration_string.
2

2
  .max_connections
2
    -- integer representing the maximum connected players permitted on this moo.
2
  .connection_limit_msg
2
    -- string printed out when this is reached.
2
  .lag_exemptions
2
    -- list of non-wizard players who may login anyway.
2

2
  .argon2
2
    -- parameters for hashing passwords. See HELP ARGON2 for information on the
2
       options available. 
2

2
Other verbs
2
   :registration_string()      => .registration_string with substitutions
2
   :newt_registration_string() => .newt_registration_string with substitutions
2
   :player_creation_enabled(connection) 
2
       decides whether someone on connection should be allowed to create 
2
       a player.  If you decide this shouldn't depend strictly on the blacklist
2
       and on the value of .create_enabled, here's where the extra code can go.
2
   :check_for_shutdown()
2
       prints a warning message to append to the login banner in the event 
2
       that the server will be going down soon.
2
   :check_player_db()
2
       prints a warning message to append to the login banner in the event 
2
       that $player_db is being reloaded to warn players that their character
2
       names might not be recognized.

The Generic Container (for programmers)
2

2
In addition to the command verbs described under `help containers'
2
and the _msg properties described in `help container-messages',
2
the following verbs and properties are available for use within programs
2

2
.opened == TRUE iff the container is open
2
.dark   == TRUE iff the contents of the container may be seen
2
.opaque -- describes the correlation between .open and .dark
2
   == 0  container is always !dark
2
   == 1  container is dark iff it is closed
2
   == 2  container is always dark              
2

2
:set_opaque(newvalue)   
2
  changes the .opaque value for the container
2
  => newvalue or E_PERM or E_INVARG
2

2
:set_opened(newvalue)   
2
  opens/closes the container (updates .open and .dark) according to newvalue
2
  => newvalue or E_PERM
2

2
:is_openable_by(player) 
2
 what the :open command uses to test whether the player should be able to open
2
 the container.  By default this refers to .open_key  (set by
2
 @(un)lock_for_open), but the object owner is free to customize this.
2

2
N.B.:  There is no way to directly set .dark; .dark can be changed only by 
2
changing one of .opaque or .opened.  Use :set_opaque(0) and :set_opaque(2)
2
to have .dark change independently of the value of .opened.

$mail_agent
2

2
This object contains a two distinct sets of routines:
2

2
  1.  utilities for performing basic mailsystem functions, e.g.,
2
      matching on recipient names, resolving mail forwarding, 
2
      formatting messages, sending messages
2

2
Recipient Matching
2

2
match           - match on a $mail_recipient
2
match_recipient - match on either a $mail_recipient or a player
2
match_failed    - print angry messages to the user for $failed/ambiguous_match
2

2
look_self  - provides a list of available $mail_recipients
2
check_names
2
touch
2
accept
2

2
Message Format
2

2
make_message        - produces a message in the canonical transmission format
2
name                - single recipient     => string for address field
2
name_list           - list of recipients   => string for address field
2
parse_address_field - address field string => object list
2

2
Sending Messages
2

2
send_message  - advertised message sending routine.
2
raw_send      - raw message sending routine 
2
                (only called by $mail_editor:send and this:send_message)
2
resolve_addr  - converts a given list recipients into a list of actual 
2
                recipients and objects to be notified.
2
sends_to      - Does X forward (transitively) to Y

2
  2.  canonical versions of mail_recipient verbs
2

2
Ideally, the verbs to perform operations on a given mail recipient would be located on the recipient itself, except for the fact that these verbs also need to be located on players, which for various reasons, shouldn't be children of $mail_recipient.  Multiple inheritance would solve our problems, but we don't have it yet.  Ergo, both $mail_recipient and $player refer to the following verbs here:
2

2
display_seq_full     print entire text of messages  (@read)
2
display_seq_headers  print headers of messages      (@mail)
2
rm_message_seq       remove messages                (@rmm)
2
undo_rmm             undo last rm_message_seq       (@unrmm)
2
expunge_rmm          flush removed messages         (@unrmm expunge)
2
list_rmm             list removed messages          (@unrmm list)
2
renumber             renumber messages              (@renumber)
2
msg_summary_line     msg header => display_seq_headers/list_rmm summary line
2

2
parse_message_seq    command line msg sequence spec => message sequence
2
new_message_num      => message number of next new message
2
length_all_msgs      => number of messages (total)
2
length_num_le        => number of messages numbered <= some number
2
length_date_le       => number of messages dated <= some date
2
exists_num_eq        => true iff there exists a messsage with the given number
2
from_msg_seq         => message sequence of msgs from given sender(s)
2
to_msg_seq           => message sequence of msgs to given recipient(s)
2
subject_msg_seq      => message sequence of msgs with subjects containing text
2
body_msg_seq         => message sequence of msgs with bodies containing text
2
messages_in_seq      => list of {message number, message} pairs
2

2
messages             == :messages_in_seq(1,:length_all_msgs()+1)   (obsolete)
2

2
The $mail_agent versions of these verbs are set_task_perms(caller_perms()) and perform their operations on caller, which in turn is assumed to have done any necessary security checks.

Subscribing to Mail Recipients
2
------------------------------
2
There are two notions of being "subscribed" to a mailing list/recipient.
2

2
(1) Hard subscribed == being on the recipient's .mail_forward list so that mail sent to this list is forwarded to one's own .messages as well (see `help mail-forwarding').
2

2
(2) Soft subscribed == keeping track of a current message for this recipient and (optionally) being on the recipient's .mail_notify list.
2

2

2
Each player has a .current_message property that contains, for each recipient the player cares to keep track of, a current message number and a last read date.
2

2
player:current_message(rcpt)                 (somewhat obsolete)
2
 => player's current message number for rcpt 
2

2
player:get_current_message(rcpt) 
2
 => player's {current message number for rcpt, last-read-date for rcpt}
2

2
player:make_current_message(rcpt)
2
 => adds a current_message entry for rcpt  (NOOP if rcpt == player)
2

2
player:set_current_message(rcpt,n|E_NONE,[,date])
2
 => sets player's current message number for rcpt to n iff n!=E_NONE
2
    updates the last-read-date for rcpt to date iff date > last-read-date
2

2
player:kill_current_message(rcpt)
2
 => removes current-message info for rcpt  (NOOP if rcpt == player)
2

2

2
On $mail_recipient, .mail_forward and .mail_notify are -c so one needs to use the following verbs to actually modify them.
2

2
    :add_forward(@new_recipients)
2
    :delete_forward(@recpients)
2
    :add_notify(@new_notifiees)
2
    :delete_notify(@notifiees)
2

2
A recipient's owner is, of course, allowed to make arbitrary changes to .mail_forward and .mail_notify.  However, the default versions of these verbs also allow any player to add him/herself to a recipient's .mail_forward or .mail_notify if the recipient is readable (see `help MR-access') by him/her.
2

2
Likewise any player may use the :delete* verbs to delete him/herself from any .mail_forward/.mail_notify list, regardless of his actual access to the list.
36

2
One may always refer to a list by its object number.  In order to refer to it by name, it must be contained in $mail_agent, which holds all mailing lists, i.e., those that you want others to be able to refer to by name.
2

2
The .aliases field holds the names by which one may refer to the list, but only those names not containing spaces actually count for anything.  As with certain other types of objects (e.g., players), set_aliases() needs to be called in order to change the .aliases field.
2

2
$mail_agent:match(name) 
2
    is the canonical way to obtain the objectid of a mailing list 
2
    given the name ("*" is assumed; an initial "*" will be dropped).
2

2
$mail_agent:match_recipient(name) 
2
    is the canonical way to obtain the objectid of a list or player
2
    matching the given name.  An initial "*" indicates that this is 
2
    supposed to be a list.
2

2
$mail_agent:match_failed(objid,name) 
2
    is the mail_recipient counterpart to $command_utils:object_match_failed

2
Controlling Access to Mail Recipients
2
-------------------------------------
2
:is_writable_by(one) - one may alter/add/remove saved messages
2
:is_readable_by(one) - one may read messages.
2
:is_usable_by(one)   - one may send to this list
2

2
By default, these verbs refer to the following properties:
2

2
writers   - list of players other from the owner who can do anything
2
readers   - if == 1, indicates a public mailing list.
2
            list of additional readers (by default anyone who receives mail 
2
            sent to the list can read the saved messages).
2
moderated - if false, indicates a normal mail recipient everyone can send to.
2
            otherwise this should be a list of approved senders.
2

2
Terminology:
2
  A mailing list is "public" if everyone can read it.
2
  A mailing list is "moderated" if not everyone can send to it.
2

2
Note that while being able to write to a recipient implies being able to read from it or send to it, neither of read-ability or send-ability implies the other.
2

2
It is highly recommended that if you are creating custom mail recipients with variable reader/sender lists, i.e., you find you need to write your own :is_readable/usable/writabe_by verbs, you are best off if such verbs are of the form
2

2
  return pass(@args) || << your_test(args[1]) >>
2

2
and have .writers == .readers == {} and .moderated == 1.  This will ensure
2
 (1) wizards having write access
2
     --- necessary in order for :receive_message to work
2
 (2) writers being able to read and send (the converse being a ludicrous 
2
     situation), 
2
 (3) persons on the mail_forward list of someone with reader access will also
2
     have read access (convenient).

2
Generic Mail Recipient
2
----------------------
2
A "mail recipient" is, by definition, an object that can be sent mail.
2
Mail recipients must either be players or descendants of $mail_recipient.
2

2
One source of confusion is that the terms "mail recipient", "mail folder", "mailing list", and "mail collection" really all refer to the same kind of object.  It so happens that $mail_recipient serve several distinct functions and we tend to use whatever term happens to best match the application under discussion, e.g., it's a "mailing list" if we're playing with its .mail_forward property but it's also a "mail folder" if we're examining the messages that have been saved in it.

Note that, by default, a freshly created recipient is accessibly only by you.  If you wish to make a publically accessible recipient, set .readers=1.  Furthermore, if you want to allow a message on your recipient to be removed by its sender without your intervention, set .rmm_own_msgs=1.  Finally, in order for other players to be able to refer to your recipient by name, the object must reside in $mail_agent.  $mail_agent will not accept the object unless it has an actual description and a name distinct from all other mail recipient names/aliases.

Receiving Mail
2
--------------
2
By definition a recipient "receives" a mail message when its :receive_message verb is called with that message as an argument.
2

2
:new_message_num()
2
=> number that will be assigned to the next incoming message.
2
By default this returns the maximum of the message numbers appearing in 
2
messages or .messages_going, incremented by 1.  If the recipient is a player
2
then the value returned will be 1 higher if it conflicts with the player's 
2
current message number for him/herself.
2

2
:receive_message(msg,sender)
2
By default this first calls this:new_message_num to obtain a message number to assign to the incoming message and then appends {num,msg} to this.messages.  
2
`sender', the original sender, is supplied in case one wants different 
2
action depending on who is sending the message (e.g., mail-gagging).
2
The return value should be an error or string if :receive_message is considered to have failed in some way.  Otherwise, a number should be returned --- this number is given to any :notify_mail routines that are called and is expected to either be 0 or the number assigned to the incoming message.
2

2
Note that :receive_message can do arbitrary things, including resending the same message to a new destination.  Hacking :receive_message to resend messages is different from using .mail_forward in the following respects
2
  (1) the resent message is considered to be a distinct message having this 
2
      object as its "author" --- i.e., the From: line will necessarily be 
2
      different.
2
  (2) since this "forwarding" is invisible to the mailsystem, 
2
      there is no protection against loops and multiple copies.
2

Mail Transmission Format
2
------------------------
2
There is a standard message format used for transmitting messages.  This is the format that $mail_editor:make_message produces, and that :receive_message verbs on players and $mail_recipients expect to see.  The (currently experimental) @refile and @copym commands also use this format to transfer messages.
2

2
This *transmission* format is distinct from the *storage* format, though, for convenience this same format is often used as well for storing messages in player collections and ordinary $mail_recipient children though, in general, there is no requirement that this be the case.
2

2
A transmitted message is a list in the following form
2

2
   date (number),
2
     the time() value at the time the message was sent.
2
   from (string),
2
     the sending object (address list form)
2
     if this is not a player, an additional header will indicate the 
2
     current ownership of the object.
2
   to  (string),
2
     recipients (address list form) which can either be players 
2
     or $mail_recipient descendents.
2
   subject (string),
2
     subject of the message, or " " if there is no subject,
2
  @additional optional headers (list of strings),
2
     each header has the form "<header-name>: text" where <header-name>: 
2
     is padded out to a width of 10 columns for the convenience of 
2
     :display_message.  Currently "Reply-to: <address list>" is the only 
2
     additional header in use,
2
   "",
2
  @body of message (list of strings)
2

2
Note that the from, to and subject lines do *not* include a header name like "From:", "To:", or "Subject:".  The @'s indicate that the lists in question get spliced in (as usual), thus the entire message is a list whose first element is a number and the rest are strings.
2

2
The address lists that appear in the from and to lines is a string in the form a sequence of object ids, each enclosed in parentheses and preceded by optional text, e.g.,
2

2
  "*Core-DB-Issues (#8175), Rog (#4292), and Haakon (#2)"
2

2
The text is intended to give the current name of each object for the benefit of human readers, but is actually ignored by all header parsing routines.  The convention is that the text is either a player name or a * followed by a mailing list name.

Resolving Mail Forwarding & Notification
2
----------------------------------------
2
For each recipient of a given mail message, the following two verbs are called to determine where the message should actually go and who should be notified about it:
2

2
:mail_forward([from])
2
    should return either
2
     . a list of objects (either players or $mail_recipients)
2
         to which mail for this recipient will be redirected.
2
     . a string error message to be printed to the player sending the message.
2
         If this recipient is one of the original destinations (i.e., not the
2
         result of a previous forwarding), no mail is actually sent.
2

2
    If :mail_forward returns a nonempty list, the recipient itself will *not*
2
    actually receive the mail message unless it is included in the list.
2
    #-1 is allowed to be on the list; it is ignored but does make the list 
2
    nonempty.  Thus, having :mail_forward() return {#-1} is the canonical way
2
    to have arriving mail disappear without being kept or forwarded.
2

2
:mail_notify([from]) 
2
    should return a list of objects that are to be told about any mail sent 
2
    to this recipient (whether or not the recipient actually receives it).
2
    Said objects must have a :notify_mail verb, but other from that, there 
2
    is no restriction on what these can be.
2

2
    object:notify_mail is called with the arguments 
2
    (sender,recipients,msgnumbers) where 
2
      recipients  == list of recipients including object in .mail_notify
2
      msgsnumbers == corresponding list of :receive_message return values
2
                 (or 0 if :receive_message is not actually called, which
2
                  will be the case if the recipient forwards without keeping)
2

2
When called as part of a mail send, the `from' argument is the immediate predecessor on the forwarding chain.  The default versions of these verbs return the values of .mail_forward and .mail_notify respectively (pronoun_subbing if the value is a string), unless this is a moderated mailing list and `from' is an unapproved sender (see `help MR-access') in which case the following verbs are called instead:
2

2
:moderator_forward(from) 
2
    what :mail_forward should return for mail coming from unapproved senders
2
    This returns .moderator_forward (pronoun_subbed if a string) by default.
2

2
:moderator_notify(from)
2
    what :mail_notify should return for mail coming from unapproved senders
2
    This returns .moderator_notify (pronoun_subbed if a string) by default.
2

2
Since the :mail_forward verbs only see the previous sender in the forwarding chain, if, e.g, B is moderated but A can send to B (i.e., B:mail_forward(A) returns an actual list), then any mail sent to A goes to B even if the original sender isn't normally allowed to send to B directly.
2

2
These verbs should all allow `from' to be omitted in which case they should return as if `from' were a generic approved sender (e.g., wizard).
2

2
It should rarely be necessary to actually modify any of :*_forward/*_notify verbs, since one has a fair amount of control over their behavior via the following properties
2

2
  .mail_forward
2
  .mail_notify
2
  .moderated          (see `help MR-access')
2
  .moderator_forward
2
  .moderator_notify

Sending Mail
2
------------
2
$mail_agent:send_message(from,recipients,headers,body)
2
  from:        sender of the message 
2
               (this must be you or something you own; otherwise => E_PERM)
2
  recipients:  object or list of objects (must all be players or 
2
               $mail_recipient descendants)
2
  headers:     either a string (contents of the Subject: line) 
2
               or a list {subject,replytos} replytos is a list 
2
               of objects designated to receive replies.
2
               Use {"",replytos} to have a Reply-to: without a Subject:
2

2
This is the canonical way to send a mail message from a program.
2
This calls $mail_agent:make_message to format the arguments into an actual message (see `help mail-format') and then $mail_agent:raw_send to do the actual sending which goes as follows:
2

2
  (1) Call :mail_forward on all recipients add any new recipients thus obtained to final recipient list, keep calling mail:forward on the new recipients until we obtain no additional recipients.  If one of the initial recipients is invalid, is not a player or $mail_recipient, or has its mail_forward return a string error, then we print the error message and abort at this point with no mail being sent.  If one of the later recipients bombs similarly, error messages are printed, but in this case mail still goes out to the other recipients.
2

2
  (2) Call :mail_notify on all recipients encountered in stage (1) to get a list of objects to notify.
2

2
  (3) All final recipients receive the message (see `help receive-mail')
2
  (4) All notifications are delivered (using :notify_mail())
2

2
We return {0, @failed_recipients} if we bombed out at step 1.
2
Otherwise return {1, @actual_rcpts} indicating what mail was sent.

Database of Players
2
-------------------
2
This is an instance of the Generic Database ($generic_db) that
2
holds the {name/alias,#objectid} pairs for every 
2
name and alias of every player in the MOO.
2

2
Verbs supplied include
2

2
  :find(string)        => player or $ambiguous_match or $failed_match
2
  :find_exact(string)  => player or $failed_match (does not do partial matches)
2
  :find_all(string)    => list of all matching players
2

2
  :insert(string,player) 
2
       records that string is now a name or alias of player
2
  :delete(string) 
2
       removes string from the db
2
  :available(string)
2
       returns 1 if string is available as a player name or alias,
2
       an object if string is in use, or 0 if string is otherwise unavailable.
2
  :load()
2
       resets the db, inserting all current player names and aliases.
2

2
The internal representation and all of the above verbs (except :load() and
2
:available()) are as described for $generic_db.
2

2
It should be noted that for any application that involves resolving a player name from a command line, you should be using $string_utils:match_player() rather than $player_db:find(), since the former will deal correctly with other ways of referring to players apart from their names and aliases (e.g., literal object numbers, "me", "$no_one"...).
2

2
:load() needs to be done periodically as it is possible for the player db 
2
to get out of synch with reality.  In particular, there is currently no way
2
to block someone writing his own player :recycle() verb that neglects to 
2
remove his names from the player db.
2

2
While a :load() is in progress the .frozen property is set to 1 to indicate that any results of :find*() are not to be trusted.

Which :match...() Verb Do I Call?
2
---------------------------------
2
There are many situations where one wishes to obtain an object from a room or a player's .contents whose name/aliases matches a particular string.  There are four main verbs available for this and it is important to understand the distinctions between them and how they are supposed to be used.
2

2
(*)  LOC:match("X")
2
     -- what you get looking for something that is inside LOC and named "X".
2
        By default, this looks through LOC.contents to find a unique object 
2
        having a name or alias that has "X" as a prefix.
2

2
Essentially, you can think of :match as a contents-matching verb, though, e.g., for rooms you also get matches on exits as well.
2

2
(*)  LOC:match_object("X", YOU)           [YOU defaults to player]
2
(*)  YOU:my_match_object("X", LOC)        [LOC defaults to player.location]
2
     -- what YOU get being located at LOC and looking for something named "X".
2
        By default these both return $string_utils:match_object("X",LOC,YOU)
2

2
(*)  $string_utils:match_object("X", LOC, YOU) 
2
   -- what you *would* get *if* YOU were a typical player, YOU were inside LOC,
2
      YOU were looking for something named "X", *and* LOC were a typical place.
2

2
In other words, $string_utils:match_object describes the :match_object() algorithm for "typical places" and the :my_match_object for "typical players":
2

2
    (1)  check for "X" being one of "", "me", "here", "$something", or "#n"
2
    (2)  try YOU:match("X") i.e., something in your inventory (maybe)
2
    (3)  try LOC:match("X") i.e., some object in the room (maybe)
2

2
The distinction between these location:match_object and player:my_match_object has to do with whether the player or the location should determine what the matching algorithm is.  Which one you should use depends on the command that you are writing.  If you are writing a command with a virtual-reality flavor, then you should be respecting the room owner's idea of which objects you can "see" and thus the command should be calling the location's :match_object verb.  If you are writing a building/programming command where it is appropriate for the player to determine the matching algorithm  --- whether because the current location is irrelevant, not to be trusted, or both --- then the player's :my_match_object verb should be called.
2

2
Examples:
2

2
  `look diamond in box'
2
      calls box:match("diamond").  This is a match on the contents of box.
2

2
  `take ball', 
2
      calls player.location:match_object("ball")
2
      to determine which "ball" to take.  Note that if the room is dark, 
2
      we might not be able to find any "ball".
2

2
  `@program widget:foo', 
2
      calls player:my_match_object("widget") to get the player's own idea
2
      of what "widget" should be.  Note that if I were carrying something 
2
      named "widget" and expecting to be programming a :foo() verb on it,
2
      it would be potentially disastrous should the room where I am decide
2
      for me to be programming something else (not even necessarily 
2
      called "widget").
2

2
Object Matching Failures
2
------------------------
2
As with other matching routines, one gets back 
2

2
  $failed_match in the case of no matching object
2
  $ambiguous_match in the case of more than one matching object
2
  $nothing in the case of a blank string argument
2

2
or an object-id.  In these first 3 cases, one usually wants to translate these nonresults to the player; this is what $command_utils:object_match_failed.  The standard idiom to mimic what the builtin parser does, say, with the direct object is
2

2
  dobj = foo:match_???(dobjstr);
2
  if($command_utils:object_match_failed(dobj, dobjstr))
2
    "...give up.  nothing to do.   error message has already printed...";
2
  else
2
    "...dobj is something useful.  Continue...";
2
    ...
2
  endif
36

25
2
$no_one
2
-------
2
... is a powerless player.  He owns no objects, not even himself; nor does he own any verbs.  He is, however, a programmer and thus may use eval().  In fact his sole purpose is to evaluate questionable code.  `questionable' could be in either or both of the following senses 
2

2
(1) Its origin is sufficiently uncertain so that there is no obvious way of deciding whose permissions it should run under.
2
(2) The code itself is potentially malicious, i.e., to the extent that one does not want to be evaluating it using one's own permissions.
2

2
set_task_perms($no_one);  is thus the canonical idiom in wizard code for rendering anything that follows mostly harmless.  For use by ordinary programmers, we have:
2

2
    $no_one:eval(string)
2

2
which attempts to evaluate an arbitrary string using $no_one's permissions.
2
string is either an expression or ";" followed by one or more statements, of which the final semicolon may be omitted.  return values are what eval() would return (either {1,value} or {0,@error_messages}).
2

2
Similarly, we have
2

2
    $no_one:eval_d(string)
2

2
which attempts to evaluate the specified string, but does it without the debug flag turned on (so that, for example, you'll get an error as opposed to terminating by traceback).
2

2
And, as a helpful utility for calling verbs whose behavior may be unpredictable, there is
2

2
    $no_one:call_verb(object, verb name, args)
2

2
which calls the specified verb with $no_one's permissions.

2
Exits
2
-----
2
An exit can be renamed by either the owner of the exit or the owner of its source.
2

2
The standard verbs that are called in exit movement are:
2

2
:move(object)  - moves the object via this exit
2
:invoke()      - equivalent to :move(player)
2

2
When an exit is invoked on a particular object (via exit:move(object)), the following occurs.
2

2
(1) The exit may be locked against the object, in which case we print the 
2
   nogo messages and quit.
2

2
(2) (room=exit.dest):bless_for_entry(object) is called.  Assuming that exit is recognized by room as being a legitimate entrance (i.e., is in room.entrances), this will enable room:accept(object) to return true.
2

2
(3) object:moveto(room) is called and the various messages (see `help exit-messages') are :announced/:told.  Note that this, in accordance with the way the builtin move() (and hence the default :moveto()) works, we get a call to room:accept(object) which checks for the room itself being locked against the object, and otherwise returns true if the blessing in the previous step worked.  The move is performed, here:exitfunc(object) and room:enterfunc(object) are called.  In particular, room:enterfunc clears the blessing bestowed in (2) now that it is no longer needed.
2

2
In general, the move may fail, in which case we :announce the (o)nogo_msgs.

2
:announce_all     (@text)         => broadcasts to all
2
:announce_all_but (objects,@text) => broadcasts to all except those in objects
2

2
say, emote
2

2

2
(2)  Command recovery
2

2
:huh            (verb,args) - server hook: last chance to make sense of verb
2
:here_huh       (verb,args) - room's last attempt to parse something
2
:here_explain_syntax (this,verb,args) - attempts to explain usage of verb
2

2

2
(3)  Residency
2

2
free_home  - true => @sethome allows anyone to set his .home to be here
2
residents  - objects on this list may teleport in and/or set their homes here.
2

2
:accept_for_abode(player) 
2
            => true iff player should be allowed to set .home to this room.
2

2
@resident*s
2

2

2
(4)  Looking
2

2
dark  - true => contents are not visible
2
ctype - 0..3 for four different styles of .contents lists
2

2

2
:tell_contents (objects,ctype) - format objects according to ctype, tell player
2

2
l*ook
2

2

2
(5)  Entrance and exit.
2

2
:accept (object) - Called by move() and :moveto() before an object enters a room, if false is returned, movement is prevented.  Protocol permits this verb to make noise (though this is discouraged) as this is the only place the room will learn the object's original location.
2

2
:acceptable (object) - Called by verbs which wish to check whether movement will be possible.  Protocol prohibits this verb from making noise and requires it to return the same value as :accept would for the same arguments.
2

2
:is_unlocked_for (object) - interface with the @lock protocol.  Returns true or false depending on the state of locks for the object with the room.  Other things may prevent entrance even if this returns true.  Protocol prohibits this verb from making noise. 
2

2
:enterfunc (object) - called after entrance has succeeded.  Noise is fine.
2

2
:exitfunc (object) - called after an object has successfully left.  Noisemaking is fine.
2

2
(6)  Topology and Movement via Exits

See `help $exit' for an explanation of how the generic $exit works.
2

  :find_exact(string)    => datum or $failed_match (no partial matches)
2
  :find_all(string)      => list of all data corresponding to matching strings
2
  :find_all_keys(string) => list of all matching strings
2

2
  :insert(string,datum)  
2
       if the string is already present in the db, 
2
       changes the associated datum and returns {old_datum};
2
       otherwise enters a new {string,datum} pair and return 0.
2
  :delete(string)
2
       if there is a datum associated with string, 
2
       remove this association and return {datum}; otherwise return 0.
2
  :delete2(string,datum)
2
       if the given datum is associated with string, 
2
       removes that association and return {datum}, 
2
       if some other datum is associated with string, just return {other datum}
2
       otherwise return 0.
2
  :clearall([4|3])
2
       removes all associations from the database.
2
       optional argument changes the type of the database 
2
       (4 is normal, 3 is a kludge for when the data are simply boolean flags
2
        i.e., this is a set of strings rather than a string-indexed array;
2
        more on this below)
2

2
  count [entries|chars] in this
2
        provide some vague statistics about how big this thing is.
2

2
N.B.  As entries get made, properties belonging to $generic_db.owner will be created on the db object itself.  These properties will be created having flags as specified by .node_perms, which by default is "r", but can be changed to "" should you want to ensure that randoms don't have access to the raw information.

2
The representation is as a `trie', a tree in which each internal node corresponds to a prefix shared by two or more strings in the db.
2
Each internal node is kept in a property named " "+<prefix>, where <prefix> is a prefix shared by all strings in the subtree under this node.
2
The property value is a 4 element list
2

2
this.(" "+<prefix>)[1] = <common>
2
   maximal continuation shared by all strings beginning with prefix
2
   i.e., all these names actually begin with <prefix>+<common>
2

2
this.(" "+<prefix>)[2] = <continuations>
2
   string of all characters <c> that can follow <prefix>+<common> for which
2
   there is more than one string in the db beginning with <prefix>+<common>+<c>
2

2
this.(" "+<prefix>)[3] = <exact_matches>
2
   list of all strings in this subtree for which 
2
   the character (or lack thereof) following the <prefix>+<common> substring 
2
   suffices to determine the string.
2

2
this.(" "+<prefix>)[4] = <data>
2
   list of data corresponding to the strings in [3].
2

2
Child nodes are       this.(" "+<prefix>+<common>+<c>) 
2
       for all <c> in this.(" "+<prefix>)[2].
2
The root node is this.(" ").
2
If, e.g., there are 2 or more strings in the db beginning with a, 
2
there will be a node this.(" a").  
2
If all of these strings actually begin with "ani", then this.(" a")[1]=="ni".
2
The db consisting of the 5 correspondences
2

2
  {"animal", #1}
2
  {"anime",  #2}
2
  {"anil",   #3}
2
  {"anile",  #4}
2
  {"banal",  #5}
2

2
would be represented
2

2
this.(" ")    =={"",  "a",  {"banal"},         {#5}}
2
this.(" a")   =={"ni","lm", {},                {}}
2
this.(" anim")=={"",  "",   {"animal","anime"},{#1,#2}}
2
this.(" anil")=={"",  "",   {"anil","anile"},  {#3,#4}}
2

2
In some cases one may merely wish to hold a collection of strings without trying to associate a particular datum with each string.  One may then instead set up a db without the fourth field on each of the properties.  In this case the datum is taken to be the found string itself and that is what gets returned by :find*() in the event of a successful search.   :find and :find_key are then equivalent as are :find_all and :find_all_keys.  To setup the db this way, do a :clearall(3).  :clearall(4) reverts to the above described type of db with a separately kept datum.  Note that you can't change the type without emptying the db.  3 and 4 are currently the only db types allowed.

The Generic Editor enables a player to edit a list of strings.  While one might contrive to use it directly, it is rather intended as a parent for some actual editor.  It supplies the following commands:
2

2
say         <text>                      w*hat       
2
emote       <text>                      abort       
2
lis*t       [<range>] [nonum]           q*uit,done,pause 
2
ins*ert     [<ins>] ["<text>]           
2
n*ext,p*rev [n] ["<text>]               
2
del*ete     [<range>]                   
2
f*ind       /<str>[/[c][<range>]]       
2
s*ubst      /<str1>/<str2>[/[g][c][<range>]]
2
m*ove,c*opy [<range>] to <ins>          
2
join*l      [<range>]                   
2
fill        [<range>] [@<col>]          
2

2
$editor_help.(cmdname) descrbes cmdname
2
$editor_help.insert    descrbes insertion points (<ins>)
2
$editor_help.ranges    descrbes range specifications (<range>)
2

2
You'll notice that nowhere does it say how to load in a given list of strings or how and where one may save said list away when one is done editing.  These commands are supplied by the child editor object.  The generic editor contains only the code for editing lines, though it defines additional functions for use by the children:
2

2
  :loaded(player)
2
     returns the index (player in this.active) iff text has been loaded
2
     from somewhere, otherwise returns 0.
2

2
     Note that, by default, there is a difference between 
2

2
        having nothing loaded                (:text(who)==0) and 
2
        having loaded something with no text (:text(who)=={}).
2

2
     If you don't care about this distinction in a particular case,
2
     just do (player in this.active) instead of this:loaded(player).  
2
     If you don't want your editor to make this distinction at all, do
2

2
        @stateprop texts={} for <youreditor>
2

2
     which changes the initial value of :text() to {} 
2

2
In all functions below, 'who' is the index returned by :loaded(player) 
2

2
BTW, be careful about using 'player' in non-user (i.e., +x this-none-this) verbs --- much better to have the user verb get the index with :loaded() and then pass that around.  
2

2
Also be careful about suspend() and verbs that call suspend().  In particular, the player's index in the .active list can change during the suspend interval, so you must be sure to obtain the index (e.g., using :loaded()) again after the suspend() returns.
2

2
For your non-user verbs, we have
2

2
  :ok(who)
2
     returns E_PERM if the caller is not an editor verb and E_RANGE
2
     if 'who' does not point to a valid session.
2

2
which should take care of the more egregious security holes (but maybe not the less egregious ones).  For getting and loading text, we have
2

2
  :text(who)    
2
     the current text string list or 0 if nothing loaded yet.
2
  :load(who,text)
2
     loads the given list of strings as the text to be edited.
2
     this also resets the 'changed' flag and pushes the insertion 
2
     point to the end.
2

2
and various flags and properties (all of the set_* routines return E_PERM when not called from an editor verb, E_RANGE if who is out of bounds, E_INVARG if something is wrong with the 2nd arg, or the new value, which may not necessarily be the same as the 2nd arg (e.g., set_insertion(..,37) on a 5 line text buffer returns 6).
2

2
  :changed(who)
2
     has the text been altered since the last save/load?
2
     (the child editor gets to define what "save" means).
2
  :set_changed(who,value)
2
     Any child editor command that is considered to save the text should do a 
2
     :set_changed(who,0).  
2
     Note that if the changed flag is 0, the session will be flushed when 
2
     the player leaves the editor, so you may also want certain commands to
2
     do set_changed(who,1)...
2

2
  :origin(who)
2
     room where the player came from.  
2
  :set_origin(who,room)
2
     can be used to change the room the player will return to when finished
2
     editing.  Since origin gets set even in cases where the player teleports
2
     into the editor you probably won't usually need to do this.
2

2
  :insertion(who)
2
     current insertion point.
2
  :set_insertion(who,linenumber)
2
     linenumber needs to be a positive integer and will get 
2

2
  :readable(who)
2
     whether the current editing session has been made globally readable.
2
  :set_readable(who,boolean)
2
     change the readability of the current editing session.
2
     This is used by the publish/perish verbs.
2

2
We also provide
2

2
  :invoke(...)
2
      If the player has a previous unsaved (i.e., :changed()!=0)
2
      session, we return to it, moving the player to the editor.  
2
      If the player is already in the editor, this has no effect other
2
      than to print a few nasty messages.  In any case a :changed()
2
      session must be aborted or set_changed(,0) before anything else 
2
      can be started
2

2
      Otherwise, we pass the arguments (which are assumed to be the
2
      result of some munging of the command line) to :parse_invoke(),
2
      move the player to the editor and load whatever parse_invoke()
2
      specified.  The only interpretation the generic editor makes on
2
      the arguments is that if the boolean value of the first is true,
2
      this indicates that the player wanted to load something as
2
      opposed to resume a previous session.  Usually a command calling
2
      :invoke will have a true (i.e., nonzero number, nonempty list or
2
      string) first arg iff the command line is nonempty, in which case 
2
      'args' works fine for this purpose.
2

2
      If the command parses sucessfully (:parse_invoke() returns a list),
2
      we move the player to the editor if necessary and then call 
2
      :init_session() to set things up.
2

2
The child editor is assumed to provide
2

2
  :parse_invoke(...)
2
     given :invoke()'s arguments, determines what the player wants to edit.
2
     It either returns 0 and reports syntax errors to player,
2
     or it returns some list that :init_session() will understand.
2

2
  :init_session(who,@spec)
2
     where spec is something that was returned by :parse_invoke().
2
     Loads the text and sets the stateprops (below) to indicate that 
2
     we are working on whatever it is we're suppose to be working on.
2

2
  :working_on(who)   
2
     returns a string X as in "You are working on X."
2
     This is called by the 'w*hat' command, among other things.
2

2
Child editors may have their own properties giving state information for the various editing sessions.  The value of each such property will be a list giving a value for each player in the editor.  For each such property, you should, once the editor object has been created, initialize the property to {} and do one of
2

2
    @stateprop <propname>                 for <editor>
2
    @stateprop <propname>=<default-value> for <editor>
2
               (0 is the default <default-value>)
2

2
Henceforth, adding and deleting new editing sessions will amend the list held by the given property.  The value of the property for a given session can be obtained via this.<propname>[player in this.active] and can be changed with a corresponding listset() call.  The usual idiom for an editor command is
2

2
   if(!(who=this:loaded(player)))
2
     player:tell(nothing_loaded_msg());
2
   else
2
      ... various references to  this.<propname>[who] ...
2
   endif
2

2
To remove such a property from the list of such state properties:
2

2
    @rmstateprop <propname> from <editor>
2

2
Note that you can only do this with properties defined on the child editor itself.  
2

2
Sometimes you may wish to @stateprop a new property on an editor where active editing sessions exist.  @stateprop will fail if the property in question does not hold a list of the correct length (== length(editor.active); one value for each editing session).  You need to either give the @flush command to clear out all sessions and boot all players currently in the editor or somehow manually initialize the property to a list of appropriate values and pray that nobody enters/exits the editor between the property initialization and the @stateprop command --- this problem can be avoided by doing an eval() that does all of the initializations (beware of suspends()) and calls :set_stateprops directly.
2

2
Incidentally, the @flush command may be used at any time to clean out the editor or to remove all sessions older than a given date.
2

2
There are also numerous _msg properties that may be customized
2

2
    @depart          announced at the origin when :invoke() is called. 
2
    @return          announced at the origin the player is returned there.
2
    @nothing_loaded  printed when user attempts editing 
2
                     before anything has been loaded.
2
    @no_text         response to 'list' when :text()=={}
2
    @no_change       printed by 'what' when :changed()==0
2
    @change          printed by 'what' when :changed()==1
2
    @no_littering    printed upon leaving the editor with :changed()==1.
2
    @previous_session  printed by :invoke() when player tries to start a 
2
                     new session without aborting or saving the old one
2

2
The general procedure for creating a child editor:
2

2
. @create $generic_editor named <editor>
2

2
. define additional <editor> verbs/properties
2
    At the very least you need 'edit' and 'save' commands.
2
    Usually you can get away with just having 'edit' call :invoke();
2
    Presumably, you'll need at least a command to load text from somewhere
2
    as well as a command to save it back out.
2

2
. define a verb (somewhere) to invoke the editor 
2
    This could be just a one-liner that calls <editor>:invoke(args,verb).
2
    Either that or
2
      .  you have to set up an exit somewhere whose destination is <editor>
2
      .  you have to advertise the object number so that people can 
2
         teleport to it.
2
  
2
. @stateprop x for <editor>
2

2
. if you want the 'abort' command to boot the player from the editor do
2
    <editor>.exit_on_abort = 1;
2

2
. set <editor>.commands to be the list of additional commands defined
2
    by <editor>.  
2
    Each element of the list is itself a list of the form {name,args}.
2
  set <editor>.commands2 to be the list of commands that should appear
2
    in the `look' listing, and should be a list of strings appearing 
2
    as names in .commands on either <editor> or some editor ancestor.
2
  look at $verb_editor or $note_editor for an example.
2

2
. If you want to have help text for new verbs you define, create a child of 
2
    $generic_help and add properties to this object for each of the topics 
2
    that you want to provide help text.
2
    Finally, set <editor>.help = {this object} so that the help system
2
    knows to consult this object.

2
The Help System
2
---------------
2
When a player types help, the following list of objects is consulted for .help properties:  the player itself, all ancestors of player up to and including $player, and, if the current location is a room, the current location together with all ancestors of the current location back to and including $room.  Each help property should have as value either an object or a list of objects (otherwise we just ignore it).  These objects are then strung together as a list of `help databases' to be searched in order for the requested topic.
2

2
A help database (in the sense of anything that is usable by $player:help()) is any object having the following three verbs:
2

2
  :find_topics([string])
2
     where string is a supposed help topic, returns a list of strings,
2
     i.e., actual help topics that this db knows about, or some boolean 
2
     false value in the event that this db is clueless...
2
     If no arguments are given, this should return a list of all topics
2
     in the db
2

2
  :get_topic(string)
2
     given one of the strings returned by :find_topics this either
2
     returns a list of strings (text to be spewed to the player) or
2
     returns 1 to indicate that it has already taken care of printing
2
     information to the player.
2

2
  :dump_topic(string)
2
     like get_topic, but instead returns the raw text of a help topic
2
     as a (download/upload) script
2

2
In short if :find_topic reports that a particular db knows about a given topic
2
it returns the full topic name, so that :get_topic may be called on it later.
2
:dump_topic is used by maintainers (see $wiz:@gethelp) to edit help topics.
2

2
$generic_help and $help
2
-----------------------
2
The Generic Help Database, $generic_help, is the parent class of a particular kind of help database of which $help is an instance.  On help databases of this type, every help topic has a corresponding property, interpreted as follows:
2

2
  this.(topic) = string             
2
      one-line help text.
2

2
  this.(topic) = {"*<verb>*",@args}
2
      call this:<verb>(args,dblist) to get text where dblist is the list of 
2
      help objects that would have been consulted had the topic not been found 
2
      on this object.
2

2
  this.(topic) = other list of strings 
2
      multi-line help text
2

2
For the {"*<verb>*",...} form, the current verbs available are
2

2
  {"*forward*", topic, @rest}   
2
     - get help text for topic and then append the lines of `rest'.  
2
       rest may, in turn, begin with a "*<verb>*"...
2

2
  {"*pass*", topic, @rest}   
2
     - get help text for topic from the first help database after this one
2
       that actually has help text for topic, and then append lines of `rest'.
2
       As with "*forward*" rest may, in turn, begin with a "*<verb>*"...
2

2
  {"*subst*", @lines} 
2
     - All occurences of %[exp] in lines are replaced with the value of exp
2
         which is assumed to evaluate to a string.  
2
       All lines beginning with %;exp are replaced with the value of exp 
2
         which is assumed to evaluate to a list of strings.
2
       Evaluation is done using $no_one's permissions so exp in either case
2
       can only refer to public information.
2

2
  {"*index*", title}
2
     - returns a list of all topics in this database, arranged in columns.
2
       title is used as a heading for this index.
2

2
       In order for your help database to appear in the list presented
2
       by 'help index', your db object must be set to +r.
2

2
  {"*objectdoc*", object}
2
     - gets the documentation for the given object (i.e., object:help_msg())
2
       N.B. as with all other *verb* arguments, object must be a string.
2

2
  {"*verbdoc*", object, verbname}
2
     - gets the documentation for the named verb on the given object
2
       (i.e., any strings at the beginning of said verbcode)
2

2
Individual help dbs are free to define additional verbs that may be used in this context.  $help itself defines the following additional such verbs:
2

2
  {"*index_list*"}
2
     - returns a list of all index topics in all databases in the search list.
2
       An index topic is one whose actual text is {"*index*", something}.
2
       When creating a help db, you should be sure to make an index topic.
2

2
  {"*full_index*"}
2
     - prints indices for all help databases in the search list.
2

2
It should be noted (once again) that help databases need not be children of $generic_help, so long as they have :find_topics/:get_topic/:dump_topic working as specified above.

Generic Option Package
2
----------------------
2
It occasionally happens that one has a command or set of commands for which one wishes to provide several options/flags that a player can set to customize the command's behavior for him/herself.  Making each option a separate property is a bit expensive, especially when the option in question is merely a boolean flag that gets set to false in most cases.  This package provides an alternative, as well as providing a uniform set of commands for setting these flags/options and checking that the values given are of appropriate types.
2

2
Instead of needing several properties, only one is required to store a list containing values for all of the options.  An "option package" (pkg, below) is then an object of this class, which provides routines for manipulating such lists.
2

2
The set of option names is divided into a set of "real" options, those whose names will actually appear in a given list, and "extras" which are either synonyms for or represent combinations of real options.
2

2
 pkg:add_name(name)      adds name to .names  (remove it from .extras if there)
2
 pkg:add_name(name,1)    adds name to .extras (remove it from .names if there)
2
    => 1 - ok, 0 - already added, E_INVARG - illegal name, E_PERM
2

2
 pkg:remove_name(name)   remove name from either .names or .extras
2
    => 1 - ok, 0 - not present, E_PERM
2

2
For setting or retrieving values we have
2

2
 pkg:get(options,name) 
2
    => value (or 0 if name isn't a real option)
2
 pkg:set(options,name,value)
2
    => revised options (or string error message if something goes wrong)
2

2
By default, a given option can only be a boolean flag, having one of the values 0 (absent from the list), or 1 (present in the list).  :set translates 0/""/{} to 0 and any other non-object value to 1.
2

2
One may however designate a wider range of possible values for an option "foo" by either installing one of
2

2
  pkg.type_foo
2
    -- list of allowed types, 
2
       e.g., {NUM,STR}   => must be a number or a string
2
       e.g., {OBJ,{OBJ}} => must be an object or a list of objects
2
    for anything fancier use:
2

2
  pkg:check_foo(value)
2
    => string error message or {value munged as desired}
2

2
In general, the only restriction on option values is that 0 is the only false value; setting an option to "" or {} sets it to 0.  Every option defaults to 0, and no matter what you install as .type_foo or :check_foo(), 0 will always be a legal value for option "foo".
2

2
When presented with an option that is in .extras, :set will typecheck the value as described, however, then :actual(name, value) will be called to obtain a list of {name-of-real-option, value} pairs indicating which combination of real options should be set.
2

2
Other verbs
2
  pkg:parse(args,...)
2
    parses the command line arguments of a @whatever_option command
2
    => {optionname, value}  if the player wants to set an option
2
    => {optionname}         if the player wants to view an option
2
    => string error message  otherwise
2

2
  one may install pkg:parse_foo to parse arguments for option "foo" 
2
    !foo     => {"foo",0}  (:parse_foo not called)
2
    foo=     => {"foo",0}  (:parse_foo not called)
2
    -foo     => {"foo",0}  (:parse_foo not called)
2
    +foo     => pkg:parse_foo("foo",1)
2
    foo=word => pkg:parse_foo("foo","word")
2
    foo word1 word2    => pkg:parse_foo("foo",{"word1","word2"})
2
    foo is word1 word2 => pkg:parse_foo("foo",{"word1","word2"})
2

2
 pkg:show(options,name|list of names)
2
    => list of strings describing the current value of the named option(s).
2
       calls     pkg:show_foo(options,list of names) or
2
       refers to pkg.show_foo
2
       to describe option "foo"

Message Sequences
2
-----------------
2
A "message sequence" is a handle by which one may refer to a particular subset of a mail recipient's (player or $mail_recipient-descendant) saved messages.  Routines like rcpt:display_seq_headers or rcpt:display_seq_full need to be supplied with message-sequence arguments to deterimine which headers or full-messages to display.
2

2
Message sequences can in turn be obtained from routines like rcpt:parse_message_seq, which takes a command-line description of a message sequence on that particular recipient and returns the corresponding message sequence handle.
2

2
The actual form of a message sequence (though you shouldn't actually need to make use of this) is that of a set of integers in the format used by $seq_utils (see `help $seq_utils').  It should however be noted that these integers are *not* themselves message numbers, but rather indices into the list of saved messages.  For example, if a particular recipient holds 5 messages numbered 1,3,5,7,9.  Then the message sequence handle representing messages 3,5,7 collectively, would be {2,5} which is $seq_utils-ese for the range 2..4, namely the second, third and fourth messages saved on that recipient.
2

2
The following verbs are available for obtaining indices to use in message sequences
2

2
  :length_all_msgs()    => total number of messages, or equivalently,
2
                        => index of last message
2
  :length_num_le(n)     => number of messages numbered <= n, or equivalently,
2
                        => index of highest numbered message <= n
2
  :exists_num_eq(n)     => 0 unless there exists a message numbered n in which
2
                           case we return the index of that message.
2
  :length_date_le(date) => number of messages dated <= date, or equivalently,
2
                        => index of most recent message dated <= date
2

2
  :length_date_gt(date) => number of messages dated > date
2

2
Note that r:length_date_gt(date) == r:length_all_msgs()-r:length_date_le(date).
2
The only reason :length_date_gt is provided as a separate routine is in order 
2
to do quick checks for the existence of new mail (as @rn needs to do).

Read verbs
2
----------
2
The following verbs may be used to extract headers/messages from readable mail recipients/players;
2

2
:display_seq_headers (message sequence, current message number, last_read_date)
2
  Does a @mail listing of the given message sequence.  If current message
2
  number is given and the sequence includes it, we mark it with a `>'.
2
  Likewise if the sequence includes any new messages (i.e., dated after 
2
  last_read_date), these are also indicated as such.
2

2
display_seq_full (message sequence, preamble)
2
  Does a @read listing of the given message sequence.  Each message is preceded
2
  by preamble.
2
  => {new current message number, new last_read_date}
2

2
:messages_in_seq (index)
2
  => {n, msg}
2
:messages_in_seq (message sequence)
2
  => {{n_1,msg_1},{n_2,msg_2},...}
2
  where the n_i are message numbers and the msg_i are messages in transmission
2
  format (see `help mail-format')
2

2
:list_rmm ()
2
  Does an `@unrmm list' listing of messages in .messages_going

2
Write verbs
2
-----------
2
The following verbs can be used to manipulate writable mail recipients/players:
2

2
:rm_message_seq (message sequence)
2
  Does an @rmmail.  Messages in message sequence are removed from this 
2
  recipient's saved .messages and written to .messages_going.
2

2
:undo_rmm ()
2
  Does an @unrmm.  Messages in .messages_going are copied back to .messages.
2

2
:expunge_rmm ()
2
  Does an @unrmm expunge.  Blows away .messages_going.
2

2
:renumber ()
2
  Does a @renumber.
2

2
Search verbs
2
------------
2
The following verbs can be used on a readable mail-recipient/player to search for messages with fields matching a given pattern.
2

2
from_msg_seq (objectid or list [,mask])
2
  => message sequence: messages from (one of) the given objectid(s)
2

2
%from_msg_seq (string or list [,mask])
2
  => message sequence: messages with (one of) the given string(s)
2
     in the From: line
2

2
to_msg_seq (objectid or list [,mask])
2
  => message sequence: messages to (one of) the given objectid(s)
2

2
%to_msg_seq (string or list [,mask])
2
  => message sequence: messages with (one of) the given string(s)
2
     in the To: line
2

2
subject_msg_seq (string [,mask])
2
  => message sequence: messages with given string occurring in Subject:
2

2
body_msg_seq (string [,mask])
2
  => message sequence: messages with given string occurring in body of message
2

2
In all cases `mask' is a message sequence which one may supply to limit the range of the search.  One way of looking at it is that the message sequence to be returned is first intersected with mask.

2
The housekeeper is an object that can help keep other objects where they belong.  New MOOs may want to add their own user interface for the housekeeper; here is some information that may be helpful.
2

2
To indicate what objects should be cleaned:
2

2
  :add_cleanup(object[, requestor[, where]])
2
    Ask the housekeeper to clean 'object' for 'requestor' to 'where'.
2
    Requestor defaults to 'player'.
2
    Where defaults to object.location.
2

2
  :remove_cleanup(what[, requestor])
2
    Remove 'what' from the cleanup list at 'requestor's request.
2
    Will remove it only if 'requestor' made the original request and owns
2
    the object or the destination.
2

2
To actually get the housekeeper to clean stuff up:
2

2
  :cleanup([insist])
2
    Clean up player's objects.  Argument is 'up' or 'up!' for manually
2
    requested cleanups.  'up!' means to clean things even if it's against
2
    the housekeeper's better judgement.
2

2
  :replace(object[, insist])
2
    Clean up the indicated object.  'insist' is as in :cleanup.
2

2
  :continuous()
2
    Starts the housekeeper cleaning continuously, killing any previous
2
    continuous task.  This should be called only when starting up a new MOO,
2
    or if something has gone wrong, as normally it will just keep going
2
    without any help.
2

2
  :litterbug()
2
    Clean up all the places in housekeeper.public_places by getting rid of
2
    all contents not in their .residents lists.  This is called by
2
    :continuous, so it doesn't need to be called directly.
2

2
To find out what's being cleaned to where for whom:
2

2
  :cleanup_list([whom])
2
    Show 'player' the personal cleanup list for 'whom', or the housekeeper's
2
    complete list if no argument is given.
2

2
  :clean_status()
2
    Show 'player' a brief summary of eir personal cleanup list.

$recycler
2
=========
2

2
Rather than having the server built-in recycle() and create() functions handle the creation and destruction of objects, a recycling center has been created to simulate these actions by  changing objects that would have been recycled into children of $garbage (The Generic Garbage Object) and making them owned by Hacker, and then when they're needed again, to avoid a raw create() command, those objects are given to whoever's asking for them.
2

2
Most Useful Verbs
2
-----------------
2

2
$recycler:_recycle( object )
2
  This will effectively recycle an object. (As a point of fact, it changes ownership of the object to Hacker and makes the object a child of $garbage.)  It handles .ownership_quota and .owned_objects properly.  Generally, use this instead of a recycle() in your verbs.
2

2
$recycler:_create( parent object [ , new owner object ] )
2
  This effectively creates an object (with the specified parent, if possible, and with the specified owner, if possible; these are the same restrictions as on the server create() builtin).  This is what should generally be used instead of create() in your programming.
2

2
$recycler:valid ( object )
2
  This is a variant of the server built-in valid() except that it handles the $garbage objects as well.  It returns a 1 if the object specified -is- valid and is -not- a $garbage object.
2

2
Other Notes
2
-----------
2

2
request <object> from <recycler>
2
  This is not an internal verb (it's !x).  It is, however, a command-line verb that can be used to request a specific object from the recycler.  It's also useful for the creation of objects like a Magic Number Repository.  When the object is removed from the recycler, the .announce_removal_msg is announced to the room if it's set (it's piped through $string_utils for pronoun substitution).
2

2
show-history <recycler>
2
  This is a wizardly verb which allows wizards to check the `history list' of the recycler. The history maintains the latest ($recycler.nhist) entries.
2

2
$recycler.orphans
2
  This maintains a list of objects for which the recreation process got mangled. It ought to be checked every once in a while to see what's up.
2

2
$error
2
======
2

2
The Error Generator, $error, may be used to automatically generate errors. This is particularly useful if you are working in a !d verb but have occasion to -want- to crash with traceback. To raise a specific error, use $error:raise(error type) -- for example, $error:raise(E_PERM) will produce traceback resulting from a Permission Denied error.
2

2
Random notes about $error:
2

2
+ The complete list of errors is stored in $error.names.
2
+ The seemingly useless :accept() verb on $error is so that $error:E_RECMOVE and $error:E_NACC will be guaranteed success (success meaning, of course, a termination by traceback).
2
+ There is, unfortunately, no way to raise the error E_NONE.

Generic BigList Utilities
2
----------------------------
2
$biglist is a collection of routines for maintaining huge persistent (sorted) lists in a format that is less likely to spam the server (which runs into a certain amount of trouble dealing with long ordinary lists --- btw we use `biglist' to refer to the huge data structure we're about to describe and `list' to refer to ordinary MOO lists {...}).  The biglist in question lives on a particular object, to which we will refer in the discussion below as the `home' object, and its various elements appear as leaves of a tree whose nodes are kept in properties of the home object.  It should be noted that the home object does not need to be (and in fact should *not* be) a descendant of $biglist one; $biglist merely provides utilities for manipulating the properties on the home object that are used in a particular biglist manipulation.  
2

2
All of the utilities below refer to `caller' to locate the home object.  Thus verbs to manipulate a given biglist must be located on or inherited by its home object itself.  The home object needs to define the following verbs
2

2
  :_make(@args)     => new property on home object with value args
2
  :_kill(prop)      delete a given property that was created by :_make
2
  :_get(prop)       => home.prop
2
  :_put(prop,@args) set home.prop = args
2
  :_ord(element)    given something that is of the form of a biglist element
2
                    return the corresponding ordinal (for sorting purposes).
2
                    If you never intend to use :find_ord, then this can be a 
2
                    routine that always returns 0 or some other random value.
2

2
See $generic_biglist_home or $big_mail_recipient for examples.
2

2
Those of the following routines that take a biglist argument are expecting
2
either {} (empty biglist) or some biglist returned by one of the other routines
2

2
  :length(biglist)          => length(biglist) (i.e., number of elements)
2
  :find_nth(biglist,n)      => biglist[n]
2
  :find_ord(biglist,k,comp) => n where n is
2
     the largest such that home:(comp)(k,home:_ord(biglist[n])) is false, or
2
     the smallest such that home:(comp)(k,home:_ord(biglist[n+1])) is true.
2
     Always returns a value between 0 and length(biglist) inclusive.
2
     This assumes biglist to be sorted in order of increasing :_ord values 
2
     with respect to home:(comp)().
2
     Standard situation is :_ord returns a number and comp is a < verb.
2

2
  :start(biglist,s,e)  => {biglist[s..?],@handle} or {}
2
  :next(@handle)       => {biglist[?+1..??],@newhandle} or {}
2
     These two are used for iterating over a range of elements of a biglist
2
     The canonical incantation for doing
2
        for elt in (biglist[first..last])
2
          ...
2
        endfor
2
     is
2
        handle = :start(biglist,first,last);
2
        while(handle)
2
          for elt in (handle[1])
2
            ...
2
          endfor
2
          handle = :next(@listdelete(handle,1));
2
        endwhile
2

2
The following all destructively modify their biglist argument(s) L (and M).
2

2
  :set_nth(L,n,value)  =>  L[n] = value
2
     replaces the indicated element
2

2
  :insert_before(L,M,n) => {@L[1..n-1],@M,@L[n..length(L)]}
2
  :insert_after (L,M,n) => {@L[1..n],  @M,@L[n+1..length(L)]}
2
     takes two distinct biglists, inserts one into the other at the given point
2
     returns the resulting consolidated biglist
2

2
  :extract_range(L,m,n) => {{@L[1..m-1],@L[n+1..]}, L[m..n]} 
2
     breaks the given biglist into two distinct biglists.
2

2
  :delete_range(L,m,n[,leafkiller]) => {@L[1..m-1],@L[n+1..]}
2
  :keep_range  (L,m,n[,leafkiller]) => L[m..n]
2
     like extract_range only we destroy what we don't want.
2

2
  :insertlast(L,value)  => {@L,value}
2
     inserts a new element at the end of biglist.  
2
     If find_ord is to continue to work properly, it is assumed that the 
2
     home:_ord(elt) is greater (comp-wise) than all of the :_ord values
2
     of elements currently in the biglist.
2

2
  :kill(L[,leafkiller]) 
2
     destroys all nodes used by biglist.  
2
     Calls home:leafkiller on each element.

$guest_log

2

2
.connections -- actual list of events, the most recent ones first
2
    each element is of the form

      {object, is_connect, time, site}
2
    object is the particular guest that (dis)connected
2
    is_connect 1 or 0 according as this is a connect or not.

2
  => site name of WHO at the particular time

$news
2
-----
2
This object is a mail_recipient like any other (see `help $mail_recipient').  One may send messages to it and use the usual recipient manipulation commands (@mail, @read, @rmm,...).  
2

2
Selected messages on this recipient are ordered in reverse date order (i.e., most recent first) and concatenated to produce the "news" that is printed in response to the player `news' command.  Each news item is thus a distinct message.  The default $player:confunc checks to see if any new messages have been selected for inclusion in the "news" since the player last read the news.
2

2
The property $news.current_news holds the message sequence of messages currently considered as comprising "the news".  The following commands are used to change .current_news:
2

2
  @addnews <message-seq> to %[$news]
2
  @rmnews <message-seq> from %[$news]
2
  @setnews %[$news] to <message-seq>
2

2
@addnews includes the specified messages, @rmnews excludes the specified messages, and @setnews changes .current_news to be the given message sequence.  Note that these ONLY change whether a given message is marked as being "in the news" and do not actually add or remove messages from the mail recipient $news.
2

2
The procedure for adding a news article is
2

2
  Send a mail message to %[$mail_agent:name($news)]
2
  @addnews last to %[$news]
2
    This marks the message as belonging to the current newspaper.
2
    This also announces to any player who have not yet read this message 
2
    that there is a new version of the newspaper.
2

2
The preferred method for updating a news items is to send a new version of the item, @rmnews the old version and @addnews the new one.
2

2
The following ordinary mail commands behave differently
2
  @rmm   removes any reference to message from .current_news 
2
         in addition to removing the message itself from .messages
2
  @unrmm completely undoes the effect of the previous @rmm; 
2
         this includes restoring .current_news.
2

2
By default, the newspaper is moderated, however there is the possibility of unmoderating it (see `help MR-access'), letting arbitrary players send mail to it; administrators could then @addnews those items deemed worthy.

2
The mail messages stored in mail recipients may be removed automatically by a weekly expiration task. New core owners who wish to turn this feature on and cut down on the db space used by mail recipients (Remember, players are mail recipients too) should start this task:
2

2
    $wiz_utils:expire_mail_weekly
2

2
When this task runs, it searches through all mail recipients and checks their .expire_period property. This property contains a time, in seconds, that messages should expire after. If this property is set to 0, then no expiration will take place from that recipient. The task, then, will compile a list of messages that are older than the expire period (e.g., if the property is set to 30 days, messages older than 30 days from the current date will expire). The default expiration period for mail recipients is 30 days.
2

2
Normally, when the mail messages are expired from the recipient they are deleted. However, the owner of the recipient may elect to have the messages mailed to an email address prior to their erasure. There are two methods for doing this, one for players and one for children of $mail_recipient.
2

2
Players:
2

2
  Players may completely turn off mail expiration by setting the mail option `expire' off. If it is on, then $mail_agent.player_expire_time is the expire period used for mail on players. 
2
  If a player has a registered email address, he may simply turn the mail option `no_auto_forward' off in order to have the expired messages sent to his email address before they are deleted. (The reversed logic saves on db space). See `help mail-options' and `help @registerme'.
2

2
Mail Recipients:
2

2
  The command to set the expiration period of a mail recipient is:
2

2
    @set_expire <recipient> to <time>
2

2
The <time> specified can be in english format (30 days, 60 days, etc.). If left off (the owner types `@set_expire <recipient> to'), the command will print out the current expiration information for that recipient. A list owner may set the expiration period up to a maximum of 180 days.
2

2
  Similar to players, the owner of a mail recipient may have the mail sent to either his registered email address or to any other address he specifies before it expires. To prevent unsolicited email from going to a random address, confirmation must be made before the owner may set the address to something other than his registered address.
2

2
  The command is:
2

2
    @register <recipient> to <address>
2

2
If the owner leaves off the <address>, the current registered address (if any) and expiration period will be returned. Again, if the address specified is the player's registered address, nothing more need be done. If it is not, then an email message will be sent to that address containing a password. Presumably, the owner can retrieve that password and then log back into the MOO and type:
2

2
   @validate <recipient> with <password>
2

2
which will enable the mail forwarding before expiration.

Generic Large Capacity Mail Recipient
2
-------------------------------------
2
Since any modifications to large lists entail copying the entire list over, operations on ordinary mail recipients having large numbers of messages, that actually change the content of .messages will take inordinately long.  Thus we have this version which makes use of the $biglist package, scattering the messages onto numerous properties so that write operations involving only a few messages will not require recopying of the entire list.
2

2
In nearly all respects it behaves as the ordinary Mail Recipient, except that it is faster for certain kinds of operations.
2

2
Certain unimplemented verbs, like :date_sort(), and :messages() currently return E_VERBNF.
2

2
To convert an existing $mail_recipient-child (call it #MR) into a $big_mail_recipient-child the basic procedure is
2

2
    ;;something.foo= #MR:messages();
2
    @rmm 1-$ from #MR
2
    @unrmm expunge
2
    @chparent #MR to $big_mail_recipient
2
    ;#MR:receive_batch(@something.foo);
2

2
Reconstructing Damaged Big Mail Recipients
2
------------------------------------------
2
On rare occasions, the tree structure created by $biglist can be corrupted (this can happen on lists sufficiently large that a list-modification operation (e.g., @rmm, @renumber) runs out of ticks/seconds).  In the vast majority of such cases, your messages are all still there; it's simply that the tree we use for finding/searching them is messed up.

create a fresh $big_mail_recipient (#NEWBMR) and then do the following:
2

2
   ;#NEWBMR:restore_from(#DBMR)
2

2
When this finishes, #NEWBMR will contain all of the mail messages we were able to find.  (note that this will include messages that you had deleted from #DBMR but not expunged).  #NEWMBR should thenceforth be useable in place of #DBMR, however if #DBMR contains custom verbs and non-clear properties, these will also need to be copied over.
2

2
Alternatively, one may do
2

2
   @copyobject #DBMR to #TEMPBMR
2
   ;#DBMR:restore_from(#TEMPBMR)
2

2
to rebuild #DBMR in place.  This, however, will take about twice as long.

Calling #OBJ:restore_from(...) COMPLETELY AND IRREVOCABLY REMOVES ALL MESSAGES from the object that it is run on (#OBJ); you MUST be sure to EITHER have made a copy of #OBJ OR be doing the restore to a DIFFERENT object.

OBJECT:init_for_core([CORE_VARIANT_SPEC])
2

2
This verb is called in the final stage of core extraction (see $wiz:make-core-database), which occurs after all non-core objects have been recycled, the remaining ones have been renumbered and moved to #-1.  This verbcall then performs any final cleanups to establish the initial state of the object and is (pretty much) the last thing to happen to the object before the new core database is saved.
2

2
What exactly goes in an :init_for_core verb varies hugely.  Some considerations:
2

2
(1)  The :init_for_core verbs are invoked from the top down, i.e., a given object's :init_for_core call verb precedes that of any of its children.  Thus, when a given object's init_for_core() runs, you can safely assume that its entire ancestor chain has already been initialized in this way, and likewise that NONE of the descendants have been initialized yet.
2

2
(2)  For non-ancestral objects, all bets are off --- with a few exceptions, you should not assume that they will be in working order, i.e., only invoke verbs that you know aren't being changed, and don't mess with their properties.   Or if you must, make sure whatever you do works in BOTH the case where the other object's init_for_core has already run AND the case where it has not.
2

2
(3)  The object's own properties, where they contain references to other objects, will be GARBAGE; renumber() does not update object values within properties or lists.  That's your job (i.e., you qua author of :init_for_core).
2

2
(4)  The root object's :init_for_core will copy code from any verb whose name ends in "(core)" to the corresponding verbname obtained by dropping that suffix.  So, for example, if you find yourself writing 'set_verb_code(this, "verbname", {...})', you should instead create a (non-executable) "verbname(core)" verb, so as to have the verbcode in a place where you can edit it in a more readable form.  This means...
2

2
  (4a)  For non-root objects, it is very important that pass(@args) be called.
2
        And yes the @args need to be there, too, since while the 
2
        CORE_VARIANT_SPEC argument is currently unspecified and ignored
2
        by all existing init_for_core verbs, it is intended to mean
2
        mean something someday.
2

2
  (4b)  A given object's init_for_core will be applied to every descendant.
2
        Bracket the parts that only apply to the object itself with 
2

2
	   if ($code_utils:verb_location() == this)
2
	     ... 
2
	   endif
2

2
(5) Oddly enough, init_for_core verbs by default become part of the core database.  You can arrange for them to remove themselves, but in the cases where they're performing generic sorts of initializations that are likely to be applicable to other MOOs, it's best to leave them in place.  This is for the sake of other MOO admins who may, after some amount of their own development, want to (re)extract their own cores.  While they will most likely be modifying the various init_for_core verbs as needed, if they do NOT make such modifications then (ideally) a core extraction should produce the same core they started with.
2

2
Thus,
2

2
   (5a) init_for_core should be IDEMPOTENT; i.e., running it a second time on the
2
        same object should achieve the same result.  So, e.g., rather than
2

2
          player.current_message = {@player.current_message, {this, 0, 0}};
2

2
        which will create a duplicate entry the second time around, do
2

2
          player:set_current_message(this, 0, 0, 1);
2

2
   (5b) init_for_core should not depend on any non-core verbs/properties.  
2
        In particular, if your init_for_core deletes a LambdaMOO-specific 
2
        verb/property and you don't arrange to delete the init_for_core as well,
2
        then you should bracket that call (e.g., with `... ! E_PROPNF,E_VERBNF')
2
        so that it will work elsewhere even after said verb/property is long gone.
2

2
   (5c) if your init_for_core has a large amount of LambdaMOO-specific material, 
2
        consider splitting the verb into 
2

2
        (*) an :init_for_core that eliminates the LambdaMOO-specific material,
2
            and 
2

2
        (*) an :init_for_core(core) that accomplishes the generic initialization
2
            (and will be copied into place by $root_object:init_for_core so that
2
            ONLY the generic stuff escapes to the outside world.).  
2

2
        You can arrange for BOTH verbs to be called as follows:
2

2
	#foo:init_for_core
2
	if (caller_perms().wizard)
2
	  pass(@args);  // copies :init_for_core(core) to this
2

2
	  if ($code_utils:verb_location() == this)
2
	     // wipe LambdaMOO-specific properties/verbs from this object
2
	     ...
2
	     // call init_for_core(core) code
2
	     this:init_for_core()
2
	  endif
2
	endif
2

2
        though again, this depends on the various parent verbs being idempotent
2
        since in this case they will be invoked twice.

2
    OBJECT:include_for_core ([CORE_VARIANT_SPEC])         => property list
2

2
$core_objects() returns a list of those objects currently considered to be part of the core database.  
2
See help 'make-core-database' for a description of the overall core database extraction process.
2

2
The list of core objects is determined by a traversal of properties starting with #0.sysobj (normally == #0).
2

2
If a given property being traversed is not object-valued or the object id is invalid we are done with that property.
2

2
Otherwise the property's value is a valid object and we call its 'proxy_for_core' verb, if one exists.  Any such verb is expected to return an object id which will then be used to update this property and any others encountered in the traversal that likewise were pointing to the same object.  If the verb does not exist we use the original property value (i.e., exactly as if the verbcode had been "return this;").
2

2
If the object thus obtained is valid, we add it to the list of core objects.
2

2
For each object added, we call its 'include_for_core' verb if one exists.  Any such verb is expected to return a list of properties on that object, which are then recursively traversed as above.  If the verb does not exist, no additional properties are traversed (i.e., exactly as if the verb had returned an empty list).
2

2
The traversal ends when there are no further properties to visit.
2

2
The CORE_VARIANT_SPEC argument is reserved for future use.  For now, the value provided to $core_objects() is passed straight through to the various hook verbs (proxy/include) and otherwise ignored.
2

2
Note that the verb '$core_objects()' can be called at any time to see the full list of objects to be included in the core as per the above algorithm.
2

2
Note that proxy_for_core is only called once for any given object during the traversal.  The IN_MCD parameter will be true for calls coming from within an actual run of make-core-database and false in all other invocations of $core_objects().  Thus, provided IN_MCD is true, it is safe for proxy_for_core to create an object to return.

Syntax:  make-core-database
2

2
!!! NOTE:
2
!!! 
2
!!! This is, by design, an extraordinarily destructive command, 
2
!!! one NOT INTENDED to be run in the live instance of your MOO.
2
!!! 
2
!!! While there are various safeguards to keep it from being run in
2
!!! situations where it looks like this might be the live instance of
2
!!! the MOO (e.g., >1 player connected), there are limits on how
2
!!! idiot-proof we can be.
2
!!!
2
!!! You have been warned.
2

2
The correct use of this command is in a separate process.  
2
That is, once you have identified a database/checkpoint file from which you wish to extract a core, you
2

2
(*) Run a LOCAL moo process reading from that database file,
2
    
2
(*) Connect as $owner (usually $owner == #2).
2

2
(*) Invoke ($wiz:)make-core-database
2

2
Here "LOCAL" means you have open_network_connection() disabled (so that, e.g., spurious registration email doesn't go out) and you either run the moo on a port that is not accessible from the outside world or use one of the single-user/local configurations of the server (e.g., NETWORK_PROTOCOL = NP_SINGLE or -a 127.0.0.1 on the command line) so that no one else can connect while you're destroying the world (and perhaps mess with what eventually gets saved).
2

2
Once you type 'make-core-database', the actual extraction process then goes as follows:
2

2
(1) A particular set of objects, the "core objects" as determined by,
2
    oddly enough, $core_objects(), is identified.  
2
    
2
    See 'help $core_objects' for details on the algorithm used.
2
    
2
(2) Any core object and any property/verb thereon that has a non-core owner
2
    is chowned either to the (assumed wizardly) player or $hacker 
2
    according as the item in question is wizard-owned.
2

2
(3) All non-core objects are mercilessly recycled.
2

2
(4) Core objects are renumbered and max_object is reset,
2
    so as to produce a contiguous array [#0..max_object()] of objects.
2

2
(5) All objects are moved to #-1.
2

2
(6) OBJECT:init_for_core is called on all objects having such verbs.
2
    The sequence of calls is unspecified except in that an object 
2
    is initialized prior to any of its children.
2
    
2
    See 'help init_for_core' for more on what these verbs should look like.
2

2
(7) The byte-quota statistics are redone
2

2
(8) The moo is shut down and the database is saved.

Syntax:  @check-property <object>.<propname>
2
         @check-chparent <object> to <newparent>
2
         
2
You cannot add a new property to an object if an ancestor or a descendant already defines a property with the same name.  @check-property will give you the list of all descendants of <object> that that define .<propname>.  
2

2
Likewise you cannot chparent an object to a new parent if the new parent has a property that is also defined on the object or some descendant.  Use @check-chparent to find out all instances of conflicting properties that would interfere with @chparent in this manner.
2

2
Note that @check-property requires either that you own the object or that it be writeable, the same conditions that need to hold if you are to create new properties on the object.  Similarly, @check-chparent requires that you own the object and that the new parent is either fertile or likewise owned by you.
2

2
For objects with large numbers of descendants, these commands can be time-consuming.

Regular expression matching allows you to test whether a string fits into a specific syntactic shape.  You can also search a string for a substring that fits a pattern.  See also the built-in function match()/rmatch().
2

2
A regular expression describes a set of strings.  The simplest case is one that describes a particular string; for example, the string `foo' when regarded as a regular expression matches `foo' and nothing else.  Nontrivial regular expressions use certain special constructs so that they can match more than one string.  For example, the regular expression `foo%|bar' matches either the string `foo' or the string `bar'; the regular expression `c[ad]*r' matches any of the strings `cr', `car', `cdr', `caar', `cadddar' and all other such strings with any number of `a''s and `d''s.
2

2
Regular expressions have a syntax in which a few characters are special constructs and the rest are "ordinary".  An ordinary character is a simple regular expression that matches that character and nothing else.  The special characters are `$', `^', `.', `*', `+', `?', `[', `]' and `%'.  Any other character appearing in a regular expression is ordinary, unless a `%' precedes it.
2

2
For example, `f' is not a special character, so it is ordinary, and therefore `f' is a regular expression that matches the string `f' and no other string.  (It does *not*, for example, match the string `ff'.)  Likewise, `o' is a regular expression that matches only `o'.
2

2
Any two regular expressions A and B can be concatenated.  The result is a regular expression which matches a string if A matches some amount of the beginning of that string and B matches the rest of the string.
2

2
As a simple example, we can concatenate the regular expressions `f' and `o' to get the regular expression `fo', which matches only the string `fo'.  Still trivial.
2

2
The following are the characters and character sequences that have special meaning within regular expressions.  Any character not mentioned here is not special; it stands for exactly itself for the purposes of searching and matching.
2

2
`.'  is a special character that matches any single character.  Using
2
     concatenation, we can make regular expressions like `a.b', which matches
2
     any three-character string that begins with `a' and ends with `b'.
2

2
`*'  is not a construct by itself; it is a suffix that means that the preceding
2
     regular expression is to be repeated as many times as possible.  In `fo*',
2
     the `*' applies to the `o', so `fo*' matches `f' followed by any number of
2
     `o''s.
2

2
     The case of zero `o''s is allowed: `fo*' does match `f'.
2

2
     `*' always applies to the *smallest* possible preceding expression.  Thus,
2
     `fo*' has a repeating `o', not a repeating `fo'.
2

2
     The matcher processes a `*' construct by matching, immediately, as many
2
     repetitions as can be found.  Then it continues with the rest of the
2
     pattern.  If that fails, it backtracks, discarding some of the matches of
2
     the `*''d construct in case that makes it possible to match the rest of
2
     the pattern.  For example, matching `c[ad]*ar' against the string
2
     `caddaar', the `[ad]*' first matches `addaa', but this does not allow the
2
     next `a' in the pattern to match.  So the last of the matches of `[ad]' is
2
     undone and the following `a' is tried again.  Now it succeeds.
2

2
`+'  is like `*' except that at least one match for the preceding pattern is
2
     required for `+'.  Thus, `c[ad]+r' does not match `cr' but does match
2
     anything else that `c[ad]*r' would match.
2

2
`?'  is like `*' except that it allows either zero or one match for the
2
     preceding pattern.  Thus, `c[ad]?r' matches `cr' or `car' or `cdr', and
2
     nothing else.
2

2
`[ ... ]'
2
     `[' begins a "character set", which is terminated by a `]'.  In the
2
     simplest case, the characters between the two brackets form the set.
2
     Thus, `[ad]' matches either `a' or `d', and `[ad]*' matches any string of
2
     `a''s and `d''s (including the empty string), from which it follows that
2
     `c[ad]*r' matches `car', etc.
2

2
     Character ranges can also be included in a character set, by writing two
2
     characters with a `-' between them.  Thus, `[a-z]' matches any lower-case
2
     letter.  Ranges may be intermixed freely with individual characters, as in
2
     `[a-z$%.]', which matches any lower case letter or `$', `%' or period.
2

2
     Note that the usual special characters are not special any more inside a
2
     character set.  A completely different set of special characters exists
2
     inside character sets: `]', `-' and `^'.
2

2
     To include a `]' in a character set, you must make it the first character.
2
     For example, `[]a]' matches `]' or `a'.  To include a `-', you must use it
2
     in a context where it cannot possibly indicate a range: that is, as the
2
     first character, or immediately after a range.
2

2
`[^ ... ]'
2
     `[^' begins a "complement character set", which matches any character
2
     except the ones specified.  Thus, `[^a-z0-9A-Z]' matches all characters
2
     *except* letters and digits.
2

2
     `^' is not special in a character set unless it is the first character.
2
     The character following the `^' is treated as if it were first (it may be
2
     a `-' or a `]').
2

2
`^'  is a special character that matches the empty string -- but only if at the
2
     beginning of the string being matched.  Otherwise it fails to match
2
     anything.  Thus, `^foo' matches a `foo' which occurs at the beginning of
2
     the string.
2

2
`$'  is similar to `^' but matches only at the *end* of the string.  Thus,
2
     `xx*$' matches a string of one or more `x''s at the end of the string.
2

2
`%'  has two functions: it quotes the above special characters (including `%'),
2
     and it introduces additional special constructs.
2

2
     Because `%' quotes special characters, `%$' is a regular expression that
2
     matches only `$', and `%[' is a regular expression that matches only `[',
2
     and so on.
2

2
     For the most part, `%' followed by any character matches only that
2
     character.  However, there are several exceptions: characters that, when
2
     preceded by `%', are special constructs.  Such characters are always
2
     ordinary when encountered on their own.
2

2
     No new special characters will ever be defined.  All extensions to the
2
     regular expression syntax are made by defining new two-character
2
     constructs that begin with `%'.
2

2
`%|' specifies an alternative.  Two regular expressions A and B with `%|' in
2
     between form an expression that matches anything that either A or B will
2
     match.
2

2
     Thus, `foo%|bar' matches either `foo' or `bar' but no other string.
2

2
     `%|' applies to the largest possible surrounding expressions.  Only a
2
     surrounding `%( ... %)' grouping can limit the grouping power of `%|'.
2

2
     Full backtracking capability exists for when multiple `%|''s are used.
2

2
`%( ... %)'
2
     is a grouping construct that serves three purposes:
2

2
       1. To enclose a set of `%|' alternatives for other operations.  Thus,
2
          `%(foo%|bar%)x' matches either `foox' or `barx'.
2

2
       2. To enclose a complicated expression for a following `*', `+', or `?'
2
          to operate on.  Thus, `ba%(na%)*' matches `bananana', etc., with any
2
          number of `na''s, including none.
2

2
       3. To mark a matched substring for future reference.
2

2
     This last application is not a consequence of the idea of a parenthetical
2
     grouping; it is a separate feature that happens to be assigned as a second
2
     meaning to the same `%( ... %)' construct because there is no conflict in
2
     practice between the two meanings.  Here is an explanation of this
2
     feature:
2

2
`%DIGIT'
2
     After the end of a `%( ... %)' construct, the matcher remembers the
2
     beginning and end of the text matched by that construct.  Then, later on
2
     in the regular expression, you can use `%' followed by DIGIT to mean
2
     "match the same text matched by the DIGIT'th `%( ... %)' construct in the
2
     pattern."  The `%( ... %)' constructs are numbered in the order that their
2
     `%(''s appear in the pattern.
2

2
     The strings matching the first nine `%( ... %)' constructs appearing in a
2
     regular expression are assigned numbers 1 through 9 in order of their
2
     beginnings.  `%1' through `%9' may be used to refer to the text matched by
2
     the corresponding `%( ... %)' construct.
2

2
     For example, `%(.*%)%1' matches any string that is composed of two
2
     identical halves.  The `%(.*%)' matches the first half, which may be
2
     anything, but the `%1' that follows must match the same exact text.
2

2
`%b' matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning or end of a
2
     word.  Thus, `%bfoo%b' matches any occurrence of `foo' as a separate word.
2
     `%bball%(s%|%)%b' matches `ball' or `balls' as a separate word.
2

2
     For the purposes of this construct and the five that follow, a word is
2
     defined to be a sequence of letters and/or digits.
2

2
`%B' matches the empty string, provided it is *not* at the beginning or end of
2
     a word.
2

2
`%<' matches the empty string, but only if it is at the beginning of a word.
2

2
`%>' matches the empty string, but only if it is at the end of a word.
2

2
`%w' matches any word-constituent character (i.e., any letter or digit).
2

2
`%W' matches any character that is not a word constituent.

2
         @egrepall <regexp> in <object>|{<objectlist>}
2

2
@grep (@grepall) searches the given object(s) for verbs whose verbcode contains the given string as a substring of one of its lines.  
2
@egrep (@egrepall) searches the given object(s) for verbs whose verbcode contains a substring matching the given regular expression (see `help regular-expressions').
2

2
@grep and @egrep print just the first matching line in each verb found.
2
@grepall and @egrepall printed every matching line.

  help object:verbname   -- prints any documentation strings that are present
2
                            at the beginning of the program for that verb.
2
  help $<whatever>_utils -- prints general information about one of the

2
                            $list_utils, etc...), which are all libraries 
2
                            of generally used verbs.
2
  help builtin()         -- prints documentation from the programmers manual

Several kinds of statements, expressions, and functions in the MOO programming language use a notion that some MOO values are 'true' and others 'false'.
2

2
The only values that are considered true are non-zero numbers, non-empty strings, and non-empty lists.
2

2
All other values (i.e., 0, "", {}, objects, and errors) are considered false.
36

*subst*
2
A task is an execution of a MOO program.  There are five ways for tasks to be created in LambdaMOO:
2
   + Every time a player types a command, a task is created to execute that command; we call these 'command tasks'.
2
   + Whenever a player connects or disconnects from the MOO, the server starts a task to do whatever processing is necessary, such as printing out 'Munchkin has connected' to all of the players in the same room; these are called 'server tasks'.
2
   + The FORK statement in the programming language creates a task whose execution is delayed for at least some given number of seconds; these are 'forked tasks'.
2
   + The suspend() function suspends the execution of the current task.  A snapshot is taken of whole state of the execution, and the execution will be resumed later.  These are called `suspended tasks'.
2
   + The read() function also suspends the execution of the current task, in this case waiting for the player to type a line of input.  When the line is received, the task resumes with the read() function returning the input line as result.  These are called `reading tasks'.
2

2
The last three kinds of tasks above are collectively known as `queued tasks' or `waiting tasks', since they may not run immediately.
2

2
To prevent a maliciously- or incorrectly-written MOO program from running forever and monopolizing the server, limits are placed on the running time of every task. One limit is on the length of time that tasks are allowed to run: queued tasks are given %[tostr(typeof(bgs = $server_options.bg_seconds) == ERR ? 3 | bgs)], and all other tasks, %[tostr(typeof(fgs = $server_options.fg_seconds) == ERR ? 5 | fgs)] seconds to run, after which they will - if they don't suspend() or end first - raise a 'Task ran out of seconds' traceback and die. But there is a second limit which is on the number of operations a task may execute.
2

2
The server counts down 'ticks' as any task executes.  Roughly speaking, it counts one tick for every expression evaluation (other than variables and literals), one for every `if', `fork' or `return' statement, and one for every iteration of a loop.  If the count gets all the way down to zero, a 'Task ran out of ticks' traceback is raised and the task is immediately and unceremoniously aborted.  Queued tasks begin with %[$string_utils:group_number(typeof(bgt = $server_options.bg_ticks) == ERR ? 10000 | bgt)], and all other tasks with %[$string_utils:group_number(typeof(fgt = $server_options.fg_ticks) == ERR ? 30000 | fgt)] ticks.
2

2
Because queued tasks may exist for long periods of time before they begin execution, there are commands to list the ones that you own and to kill them before they execute.  These commands are covered in the following help topics:
2

2
@forked -- listing the forked tasks that you own
2
@kill -- killing a particular forked task

2
The following kinds of statements exist in the MOO programming language:
2

2
        ;
2
The null statement does nothing.
2

2
        expression ;
2
The expression statement evaluates the expression and then discards the value.
2

2
        IF ( expression ) statements ENDIF
2
        IF ( expression ) statements ELSE statements ENDIF
2
        IF ( expression )
2
          statements
2
        ELSEIF ( expression )
2
          statements
2
        ...
2
        ELSE
2
          statements
2
        ENDIF
2
The conditional statement evaluates each expression in turn and executes the statements associated with the first one to return a true value; the ELSE statements are executed if none of the expressions returns a true value.  There can be any number of ELSEIF clauses and the ELSE part is optional.  See 'help truth' for the definition of 'true value'.
2

2
        FOR name IN ( expression ) statements ENDFOR
2
The list iteration statement first evaluates the expression, which must return a list.  It then executes the statements once for each element of that list, each time with the named variable having the value of the corresponding list element.
2

2
        FOR name IN [ expression .. expression ] statements ENDFOR
2
The numeric iteration statement first evaluates the two expressions, both of which must return numbers; call those numbers N1 and N2, respectively.  The statements are then executed once for each integer I such that N1 <= I <= N2, in increasing order; each time, the named variable has the corresponding value of I.
2

2
        WHILE ( expression ) statements ENDWHILE
2
        WHILE name ( expression ) statements ENDWHILE
2
The indefinite iteration statement repeatedly evaluates the expression and, each time it returns a true value, executes the statements.  The loop stops the first time that the expression returns a false value.  The definitions of 'true' and 'false' values is in 'help truth'.
2

2
        BREAK ;
2
        BREAK name ;
2
Each `break' statement indicates a specific surrounding loop; if <name> is not given, the statement refers to the innermost one. If it is given, <name> must be the name appearing right after the `for' or `while' keyword of the desired enclosing loop. When the `break' statement is executed, the indicated loop is immediately terminated and executing continues just as if the loop had completed its iterations normally.
2

2
        CONTINUE ;
2
        CONTINUE name ;
2
Allows you to terminate just the current iteration of a loop, making it immediately go on to the next one if any. 
2

2
        RETURN ;
2
        RETURN expression ;
2
The return statement evaluates the expression, if any, and returns the resulting value (or 0 if there is no expression) to the verb that called the current one.  Execution of the current verb is immediately terminated.
2

2
        TRY
2
          statements-0 ;
2
        EXCEPT variable-1 (codes-1)
2
          statements-1 ;
2
        EXCEPT variable-2 (codes-2)
2
          statements-2 ;
2
        ... (up to 255)
2
        ENDTRY
2
Each of the `statements-x' may be any number or combination of MOO statements and function calls. Each of the `codes-x' may be either the keyword `ANY' or else a comma-separated list of expressions that yield error codes. If the execution of `statements-0' raises an error listed in the `codes-x', then the statements associated in that EXCEPT clause where the code was listed are executed. When this occurs, `variable-x' is assigned this information about the error being raised:  {<error code>, <error message>, <value>, <traceback>}. If the error raised is not listed in any EXCEPT clause (which means the `ANY' keyword was not used), then the error continues to be raised. 
2

2
        TRY
2
          statements-0 ;
2
        FINALLY
2
          statements-last ;
2
        ENDTRY
2
In this construct, `statements-0' are executed. Then, whether an error was raised by their execution or not, `statements-last' are executed. If `statements-0' transfers control somewhere else, that transfer is interrupted so that `statements-last' can be run. If `statements-last' transfers control, then that overrides the first transfer. (Transfers include raising an error, returning from this verb, terminating the current iteration of a surrounding loop). `Statements-last' will always be executed, providing a good place for necessary cleanup code that will run even if `statements-0' doesn't simply run normally to completion.
2

2
        FORK ( expression ) statements ENDFORK
2
        FORK name ( expression ) statements ENDFORK
2
The fork statement first executes the expression, which must return a number; call that number N.  It then creates a new MOO task that will, after at least N seconds, execute the statements.  When the new task begins, all variables will have the values they had at the time the FORK statement was executed.  The task executing the FORK statement immediately continues execution.  If a variable name is given after the FORK keyword, then it is assigned the 'queue ID' of the newly-created task.  The value of this variable is visible both to the task executing the fork statement and to the statements in the newly-created task.  See 'help tasks' for more information about forked tasks.

MOO contains a rich programming language for the creation of interesting rooms, exits, and other objects.  Help is available on the following topics concerning programming in MOO:
2

2
language -- a brief reference for the syntax and semantics of the MOO language
2
tasks -- a brief description of MOO tasks and their resource limits
2

2
@property -- adding a property to an object
2
@rmproperty -- removing a property from an object
2

2
@verb   -- adding a verb to an object
2
@rmverb -- removing a verb from an object
2
@args   -- changing the syntax of a verb
2
@copy   -- copying a verb from one object to another
2

2
.program/@program -- entering the program for a verb
2
@list -- printing a listing of the program for a verb
2
@edit -- editing verb code
2

2
@show     -- looking at all the details of an object, a property, or a verb
2
@parents  -- listing the ancestors of an object
2
@kids     -- listing the children of an object
2
@contents -- listing the contents of an object
2
@chmod    -- changing the permissions on an object, a property, or a verb
2
@chparent -- changing the parent of an object

The table below gives the relative precedence of all of the MOO operators; operators on higher lines in the table have higher precedence and those on the same line have identical precedence:
2

2
        !       - (without a left operand)
2
        ^
2
        *       /       %
2
        +       -
2
        ==      !=      <       <=      >       >=      in
2
        &&      ||
2
        ... ? ... | ... (the conditional expression)
2
        =
2

2
Thus, the horrendous expression
2

2
        x = a < b && c > d + e * f ? w in y | - q - r
2

2
would be grouped as follows:
2

2
        x = (((a < b) && (c > (d + (e * f)))) ? (w in y) | ((- q) - r))

The following kinds of expressions exist in the MOO programming language:
2

2
        number
2
        # integer
2
        # - integer
2
        "character string"
2
        error-name
2
Literal expressions return the obvious values: numbers (floating-point or integers), object numbers, strings, and errors.
2

2
        { expression , expression , ... , expression }
2
The list-construction expression evaluates the each of the expressions in turn and returns a list whose elements are the results of those expressions.  Any of the expressions may be prefixed with an at-sign ('@'); in this case, that expression must return a list and, rather than that list becoming an element of the final list, its elements are spliced into the final list.
2

2
        name
2
Variable expressions return the current value of the named variable.  Variable names must start with a letter or underscore ('_') and contain only letters, digits, and underscores.  The following variables are predefined:
2
            OBJ, STR, LIST, ERR, INT, FLOAT, NUM (same as INT)
2
            player, caller, this, verb, args
2
            argstr, dobj, dobjstr, prepstr, iobj, iobjstr
2
Their initial values are described in detail in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.
2

2
        expression . name
2
        expression . ( expression )
2
        $ name
2
Property-reading expressions return the current value of a named property on the object that is the value of the first subexpression.  In the second form, the second subexpression must return a string, the name of the property to be read.  The third form is an abbreviation for '#0.name'.
2

2
        expression : name ( arguments )
2
        expression : ( expression ) ( arguments )
2
Verb-call expressions invoke a named verb on the object that is the value of the first subexpression, passing the given arguments.  In the second form, the second subexpression must return a string, the name of the verb to invoke.  The syntax and semantics of arguments is exactly as in the list-construction expression but no initial or final curly-braces ('{' or '}') are used.
2

2
        function ( arguments )
2
The function-call expression invokes one of the MOO primitive functions, as listed in 'help functions', passing the given arguments.
2

2
        expression [ expression ]
2
The indexing expression first evaluates the two subexpressions; call their values S and N, respectively.  S must be a string or a list and N must be a integer between 1 and the length of S, inclusive.  The Nth element of S is returned.  The elements of a string are themselves one-character strings. The special character `$' maybe used for N as shorthand for the length of the string or list S.
2

2
        expression [ expression .. expression ]
2
The subsequence expression first evaluates the three subexpressions; call their values S, N1, and N2, respecitively.  S must be a string or a list and N1 and N2 must be integers.  If N1 <= N2, then both must be between 1 and the length of S, inclusive (the shorthand character `$' may be used); the subsequence of S beginning at index N1 and continuing through index N2 is returned.  If N1 > N2, the empty sequence of the same type as S is returned, either "" or {}.
2

2
        name = expression
2
        expression . name = expression
2
        expression . ( expression ) = expression
2
        $ name = expression
2
Assignment expressions give new values to variables and object properties.  For the second and third forms, the expressions on the left-hand side of the '=' are evaluated first.  Then the right-hand side expression is evaluated and result is stored in the indicated variable or object property.
2
There is a special kind of assignment involving lists on the left hand side. See `help scattering' for details.
2

2
        expression + expression
2
        expression - expression
2
        expression * expression
2
        expression / expression
2
        expression % expression
2
        - expression
2
        expression ^ expression
2
The arithmetic expressions evaluate the subexpressions, all of which must return numbers of the same type (integer or floating-point), and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remaindering, negation, or raising to a power, respectively.  For addition, the subexpressions may both return strings as well; in this case, the result is the concatenation of the two strings. For the last operation, raising to a power, if the first expression is an integer, the second must also be an integer. But if it is floating-point, then the second can be either floating point or an integer. This is the only type mixing permitted. You must do explicit type conversions with built-in functions (toint(), tofloat()) before evaluation mixed expressions on the other operations.
2

2
        expression == expression
2
        expression != expression
2
        expression < expression
2
        expression <= expression
2
        expression > expression
2
        expression >= expression
2
The comparison expressions evaluate the subexpressions and then test whether or not the first result is equal to, unequal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to the second result, respectively.  If the indicated relation holds then they return 1 and otherwise they return 0.  Comparisons of strings are performed case-insensitively, those of lists are performed on an element-by-element basis, objects are compared by their object numbers, and errors by an ordering given in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.
2

2
        expression ? expression | expression
2
        expression && expression
2
        expression || expression
2
        ! expression
2
The logical expressions each return results based upon the truth value of their first subexpression; call the value of this expression X.  The first of these returns the value of the second subexpression if X is a true value and that of the third expression if X is a false value; the unused subexpression is not evaluated.  The definitions of 'true value' and 'false value' are given in 'help truth'.  The expression 'E1 && E2' is an abbreviation for 'E1 ? E2 | E1' except that E1 is only evaluated once.  The expression 'E1 || E2' is an abbreviation for 'E1 ? E1 | E2' except that E1 is only evaluated once.  The expression '! E' is an abbreviation for 'E ? 0 | 1'.
2

2
        expression IN expression
2
The list-membership expression first evaluates both subexpressions; call their values E and L, respectively.  L must be a list.  If E is an element of L, then the index of the first occurence of E in L is returned.  If E is not an element of L, then 0 is returned.
2

2
        `expression-1 ! codes => expression-2'
2
NOTE: the open- and close-quotation marks are really part of the syntax; they must be typed in. `Codes' is either the keywoard ANY or a comma-separated list of expressions that when evaluated should yield a list of error codes to be caught if they're raised. If `expression-1' is evaluated without raising an error, then its value is the value of the entire expresion. If it raises an error that is listed in `codes', it is caught. If the `=> expression-2' part was included (it is optional), then it is evaluated and its value is the result of the entire expression. If `expression-2' was omitted, then the error is the value of the expression. If the error was not listed and caught, then the error contines to be raised.
2

2
The method for disambiguating the meaning of a complex MOO expression in the absence of sufficient parentheses is described in 'help precedence'.
2

2
Syntax:  eval <MOO-code>
2
         ; <MOO-code>
2
         eval-d <MOO-code>
2

2
Evaluates the given piece of MOO code and prints the resulting value.  If the MOO code begins with one of the MOO language keywords ('if', 'for', 'while', 'fork', or 'return') or with the character ';', then the entire piece of code is treated as the program for a verb, with ';' appended to the end.  Otherwise, 'return' is appended to the front and ';' is appended to the end and that string is treated as the code for a verb.  In either case, the resulting verb is invoked and whatever value it returns is printed.
2

2
For programmers, this is such a mind-bogglingly useful thing to do that there is a simple abbreviation for this command; any command beginning with a semicolon (';') is treated as a use of 'eval'.
2

2
Eval treats specially a duplicated semicolon at the beginning.  It enables you to make multi-statement programs within eval (but does not by default print the return value).
2

2
Eval-d (no ";" abbreviation for this) evaluates the following text exactly as eval, except that the "d" debug flag (see programmer's manual for explanation) is turned off.  Thus errors will cause an error return value rather than a traceback.
2

2
If you set the programmer option `eval_time' to 1 (see `help @prog-options'), then eval will print out how many ticks and seconds the program required.
2

2
Examples:
2
   eval 3 + 4
2
   =>  7
2
   ;3+4
2
   =>  7
2
   ;for x in (player.aliases) player:tell(x); endfor

   ArchWizard
2
   =>  0
2
   ;;l = {}; for i in [1..10] l = {@l, i}; endfor return l
2
   =>  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
2
   eval-d 8 + "foo"
2
   => E_TYPE  (Type mismatch)
2

2
You may customize your evaluation environment.  The player property .eval_env may contain statements to be executed prior to any evaluated program.  Two caveats:  This will throw off the tick count.  You can account for additional ticks inserted by your environment with the .eval_ticks property; just set it to the number of ticks you'd like subtracted from the total.  Additionally, if you make a syntax error in your program, the line reported will be wrong (it will count those initial statements), and if you make an error in the eval_env itself, you can be in deep trouble.  Despite these drawbacks, the eval_env property can be quite useful.  The following is a sample:
2

2
Eval_env:    "me=player;here=player.location;"
2
eval_ticks:  3
2

2
See also @setenv.
2

2
You can also define textual substitutions in a separate property, called eval_subs.  These are discouraged, however, for anything that can be done with variable assignments, because the overhead of replacing the strings in the evaluated program is significant.  However, some things, such as substituting characters which can't be typed easily on one keyboard (e.g. "[]" is difficult to type on some IBM keyboards), can only be done by textual substitutions.  Note that the eval substitutions are also interpreted by the verb editor when "eval_subs" is selected in your .edit_options property (see `help editors').  This adds to their overhead, but again, makes it possible for people to program who otherwise can't type the full character set.  Remember:  Don't use eval_subs unless you really have to!

2
Syntax:  @verb <object>:<verb-name(s)>
2
         @verb <object>:<verb-name(s)> <dobj> [<prep> [<iobj>]]
2

2
Adds a new verb with the given name(s) to the named object.  If there are multiple names, they should be separated by spaces and all enclosed in quotes:
2

2
        @verb foo:"bar baz mum*ble"
2

2
The direct and indirect object specifiers (<dobj> and <iobj>) must be either 'none', 'this', or 'any'; their meaning is discussed in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual.  The preposition specifier (<prep>) must be either 'none', 'any', or one of the prepositional phrases listed in `help prepositions' (a prepositional phrase with more than one word must be enclosed in quotes ("")).  All three specifiers default to 'none'.
2

2
It is also possible to specify the new verb's permissions and owner as part of the same command (rather than having to issue separate @chmod/@chown commands)
2

2
     @verb <object>:<verb-name(s)> <dobj> <prep> <iobj> <permissions>
2
     @verb <object>:<verb-name(s)> <dobj> <prep> <iobj> <permissions> <owner>
2

2
<permissions> are as with @chmod, i.e., must be some subset of "rwxd".  They default to "rd" (specifying "w" for a verb is highly inadvisable).  The owner defaults to the player typing the command; only wizards can create verbs with owners other than themselves.
2

2
You may also use "tnt" in place of "this none this" for the dobj prep iobj arguments.  "this none this" is used to indicate non-command verbs, since the parser can't possibly interpret a command as "this none this".  For these verbs, the permissions default to "rxd"; the "x" bit is set so that they can be called from other programs.  (If they couldn't be used as commands, and they couldn't be called from programs, they wouldn't be good for anything!)

         @rmverb <object>:<verb-name>  <dobj> <prep> <iobj>
2
         @rmverb# <object>:<verb-number>
2

2
Removes the named verb from the named object.
2
If there is more than one verb matching the given verb-name, this removes the most recently defined one.
2

2
With the 2nd form of the command the verb removed is the most recent one matching both the given verb-name *and* the given dobj/prep/iobj specifiers.
2

2
To remove the ambiguity in verbs with the same name, @rmverb# is provided where you can specify the verb by its 1-based index in the verbs() list output. Use of this form is strongly encouraged.

Usage:  @prospectus player [from number] [to number]
2

2
Like @audit, but displays more information.  The optional from and to arguments are for restricting the display to specific object numbers, if you happen to know the player only owns objects in the included range.
2

2
Example:
2
   Objects owned by Frand (from #0 to #54949):
2
     P[ 23]    #47 Frand                          [Hyperspace Hovel]

2
The K in the first column indicates that the object has children owned by other players.  A lowercase k indicates the object has children but owned only by the player.  The second column indicates whether the object is publicly readable or publicly parentable.  An r indicates readability.  A lowercase f indicates the object is both readable and allows children (is fertile).  An uppercase F indicates the object is not readable, yet allows children to be created.  (This is usually an error.)  If the object is readable by the issuer of the @prospectus command (that is, publicly readable or owned by the issuer), then the number in brackets indicates the number of verbs which have been defined on this object (not including any verbs from any parents).
2

The third column indicates what type of object this is.

2
Syntax:  @property <object>.<prop-name>
2
         @property <object>.<prop-name> <initial-value>
2

2
Adds a new property named <prop-name> to the named object.  The initial value is given by the second argument, if present; it defaults to 0.  
2

2
Normally, a property is created with permissions 'rc' and owned by whoever types the command.  However, you may also specify these explicitly
2

2
         @property <object>.<prop-name> <initial-value> <permissions>
2
         @property <object>.<prop-name> <initial-value> <permissions> <owner>
2

2
Only wizards can create properties with owners other than themselves.
2

2
'@property' can be abbreviated as '@prop'.

Syntax:  @program <object>:<verb-name>
2
         @program <object>:<verb-name> <dobj> <preposition> <iobj>
2
         @program# <object>:<verb-number>
2

2
Changes the MOO program associated with the named verb on the named object.
2
If you provide <dobj> <preposition> and <iobj> as in the second form of this command, then it is the first verb with matching direct object, preposition and indirect object specifiers that is the one getting the new program.  This is useful if you have several verbs matching the same name.
2

2
Or, you can use @program# if you know the verb's number. This is the 1-based index of the verb as it appears in the verbs() (or @verbs) output list.
2

2
Typing the @program command always puts the server into a line-reading mode, in which each line you type is saved away without any action unless said line is one of the following:
2

2
  .
2
  @abort
2
  .<text>
2

2
A period on a line by itself ends the line-reading mode and continues with the command, in this case, the saved lines are considered as a program, checked for syntax errors and, if no errors are found, installed as the new program for the specified verb.  
2

2
@abort causes the command to terminate immediately with no change to any verb's program.  .<text> enters <text> literally as one of the lines to be saved, which is used for when, e.g., you want to enter the line `.' or the line `@abort'.
2

2
Note that this command *always* enters the line-reading mode, even if the indicated verb is not found.  In this case, lines of text are still read but they are ignored.  After any @program command, you always need to type a period or `@abort' to get back into the normal command-reading mode.

2
Syntax:  @list <object>:<verb>
2
         @list <object>:<verb> [with|without parentheses|numbers] [all]
2
         @list <object>:<verb> <dobj> <prep> <iobj>
2
         @list <object>:<verb> <start>..<end>
2
         @list# <object>:<verb-number> [any of the above]
2

2
Prints out the code for the MOO program associated with the named verb on the named object.  
2

2
Normally, the code is shown with each line numbered and with only those parentheses that are necessary to show the meaning of the program.  You can e.g., specify `without numbers' to have the numbers omitted or `with parentheses' to include all parentheses or even `with parentheses without numbers' to do both.  You can change the default behavior of this command via @prog-options (which see).
2

2
Normally, the @list command only shows the code for the named verb on the object itself or on the nearest ancestor that defines it; if you give the `all' option, it shows the code for the named verb on every ancestor that defines it, as well as on the object itself.
2

2
The 3rd form of the verb lists the verb matching the given dobj/prep/iobj specification if such exists.  
2
The 4th form prints only those lines in the specified range.
2

2
Example:
2
  Type `@list $room:say' to see the code for the `say' command, or even `@list $prog:@list' to see the code implementing @list itself...
2

2
The 2nd-4th forms may be combined, e.g.,
2

2
  @list frobule:burfle this in front of any without numbers 1..10
2

2
which would be useful if `frobule' had more than one `burfle' verb and we wanted to see the first 10 lines of the one having `this' `in front of' `any' as its respective dobj/prep/iobj specifiers.
2

2
Or, if you know the verb's number, you can use @list# to unambiguously refer to the verb. The number comes from the 1-based index of the verb as it appears in the verbs() (or @verbs) output list.

Syntax:  @kill task_id

         @kill [object]:[verb]
2
         @kill soon [number-of-seconds]
2
         @kill all
2
         @kill %trailing_id
2

2

2
Immediately kills one or more forked tasks.  The '@forked' command is useful for finding out what tasks you have pending; see 'help @forked' for details.  Only the owner of a task may kill it.
2

2
@kill task_id kills only the task with that id.
2

2
@kill object:verb kills all tasks which were scheduled by the object running the verb named.  Both object and verb are optional:  @kill object: kills all tasks scheduled by that object, and @kill :verb kills all tasks which were scheduled by any object running that verb.  This can be useful if you have several similar objects which are running tasks from similarly named verbs.  (Perversely, @kill : kills all tasks...  Any object running any task.)
2

2
@kill soon kills all tasks scheduled within the next minute.  @kill soon number kills all tasks scheduled within that number of seconds, e.g. @kill soon 300 would kill all tasks scheduled within the next five minutes.  This can be useful if you have a runaway task you want to quickly remove, but don't want to kill you later tasks.
2

2
@kill all kills all tasks.  Like @kill soon, but more dramatic.
2

2
@kill %trailing_id expects you to specify the last few digits of a task id.  It then kills all tasks that end with those digits.
2

2
@killq*uiet does all of the above without the pretty printout if more than one task is being killed.  It tells you the number of tasks that have been killed when it's finished.
2

Example:
2
  @forked

Syntax:  @kids object
2

A quick way to find out the children of an object.  Prints out the names and object numbers of the found children.  Note: this is not a list of all descendents, just direct children.
2

2
Example:
2
  @kids #3107
2
  Generic Body of Chlorinated Water(#3107) has 3 kids.

2
Syntax:  @forked[-v*erbose] [all wizards]
2

2
Gives a list of all of the forked tasks you own, along with detailed information about each one.  Wizardly characters may specify `all wizards' and see the queued tasks which are owned by a player with .wizard=1. This is useful to find a task that $wiz_utils:random_wizard has put in various queues, and to also find code which is running with wizardly permissions that shouldn't be.
2

2
The information displayed includes the following:
2

2
Queue ID:
2
   A numeric identifier for the task, for use in killing it (see 'help @kill').
2

2
Start Time:
2
   The time after which the task will begin execution.
2

2
Owner:
2
   The player whose permissions under which the task is running.
2
   Unless you are a wizard, @forked will show only your tasks.
2

2
Verb:
2
   The object and verb-name of the code that forked the task.
2

2
Line:
2
   The line number of the first statement that the task will execute when it starts.  Note that the code for the verb in question may have changed since the task was forked; the forked task will use the version that was being executed when it was forked.
2

2
This:
2
   The value of `this' for the forked task, in the case that it is different from (i.e., is a descendant of) the object on which the verb code lives.
2

2
For a more verbose output, use `@forked-v*erbose'. This will display the same information as the above, but for any task which is not a fresh fork or foreground task, a callers()-style listing of the stack trace will be displayed.

2
                         ;[inherited_verb]
2

2
@display is a fancy version of @show.  As @show, it can select individual verbs or properties to display.  In addition, it can display all the verbs or properties defined on an object, or all the verbs or properties defined on any of the object's ancestors.  Don't specify a property or verbname after the punctuation mark to get the "all" feature.  Its display is more compact than that of @show (it uses a one-line format, and truncates values that don't fit in the value field).
2

2
You may mix properties and verbs on the command line, but the parser may become confused.  (E.g. @display object,: displays all properties including inherited ones plus all locally defined verbs on the object.)
2

Syntax:  @copy <object>:<verb> to [<newobject>][:<newverb>]
2
         @copy-move <object>:<verb> to [<newobject>][:<newverb>]
2

2
Copies the code of the named verb to the new object and verbname.  Permissions, and arguments of the new verb are set to match those of the old verb in the event that the new verb does not already exist.  One of <newobject> or :<newverb> must be supplied.  If no new verbname is given, the old name is retained.  Likewise, <newobject> defaults to <object> if not given.
2

2
@copy-move will delete the old verb after it has copied.  Useful for restructuring code/object hierarchies.
2

2
Examples:
2
  @copy me:verbname to myobject
2
  @copy me:test_verb to myobject:real_verb
2

2
In general, @copy'ing verbs is a bad idea.  In the vast majority of cases, the desired effect can be accomplished with parenting (i.e., having <object> be an ancestor of <newobject>), which has the advantage that if a verb is updated or fixed, this immediately becomes available to child objects that inherit this verb.  In such a case, copies that were made using @copy have to be tracked down and fixed by hand.
2

2
This facility is provided for those rare occasions where one has no choice but to actually copy the verb.

2
Syntax:  @chparent <object> to <new parent>
2

2
Changes the parent of the named object to be the named parent.  The object acquires all the verb and property definitions of its parent.  Newly acquired properties are initilialized with `clear' values so that they inherit whatever values are currently assigned to the parent's corresponding properties (see `help @clearproperty').
2

2
If the player does not own <new parent>, it must have been set `fertile'.  <object> must be owned by the player.  Neither <object> nor any descendant can define any property which already exist on <new parent>.  Use @check-chparent (see `help @check-chparent') to list such property conflicts.
2

2
It is also sometimes the case that you will own some object and want to @chparent some child of that object that you do not own.  Use @disinherit (see `help @disinherit') in such situations.

2
         @chmod <object>:<verb-name> <verb-permissions>
2
         @chmod# <object>:<verb-number> <verb-permissions>
2

2
Changes the permissions of an object, property or verb, to those given.  The following table shows what permission bits are allowed for each form of the command:
2
        <object-permissions>        r, w, f
2
        <property-permissions>      r, w, c
2
        <verb-permissions>          r, w, x, d
2

2
See the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual for their meanings.
2

2
The form @chmod# is used to unambiguously refer to a verb by its 1-based index as it appears in the verbs() (or @verbs()) output list.
2

2
To clear all of the permissions for an object, verb, or property, use "" as the second argument.
2

2
@chmod also accepts +, !, and - as modifiers for a single permission to add or subtract that permission from the current set.  (! and - are the same.)
2

Examples:
2

2
Set a verb to be Readable and Callable:
2
  @chmod chair:sit rx

2
Changes the direct object, preposition, and/or indirect object specifiers for the named verb on the named object.  Any specifiers not provided on the command line are not changed.  The direct and indirect object specifiers (<dobj> and <iobj>) must be either 'none', 'this', or 'any'.  The preposition specifier (<prep>) must be either 'none', 'any', or one of the prepositional phrases listed in `help prepositions'.
2

2
To unambiguously refer to the verb on the object, in case there are more than one with the same name, use @args#. This takes the 1-based index of the verb as it appears in the verbs() (or @verbs()) output list.

2
Provides or changes the MOO program associated with the named verb on the named object.
2

2
This command is mostly obsolete.  Use @program instead.  The only reason this command still exists is that it is a server builtin command that will continue to work in the (unlikely) event that @program gets trashed ...
2

2
This command works differently from most other MOO commands, in that it actually changes how the server will interpret later lines that you type to it.  After typing the '.program' line, you are in 'programming mode'.  All lines that you type in this mode are simply saved away in the server until you type a line containing only a single period ('.').  At that point, those lines are interpreted as a MOO program and are checked for syntax errors.  If none are found, a message to that effect is printed and the code you typed is installed as the program for the verb in question.  In any case, after typing the '.' line, you are returned to the normal input-handling mode.

Syntax:   @clearproperty <object>.<prop-name>
2

2
This clears <object>'s <prop-name> property.  That is the property value becomes `clear' and all further references to this property will use the value of the same property on the parent object.  Note that you can only clear inherited properties.  Nor is this the same as removing a property; the property continues to exist.
2

2
`@clearproperty' can be abbreviated as `@clearp'.
2

2
Example:
2

2
  @create #1 named foo
2
  You now have foo with object number #42 and parent Root Class (#1).
2
    [foo, as a child of #1 has a .description property which starts out clear]
2
  ;#1.description
2
  => ""
2
  ;#1.description = "You see nothing special"
2
  => "You see nothing special"
2
  ;#42.description  
2
  => "You see nothing special"
2
  ;#42.description = "Something special"
2
  => "Something special"
2
   [foo.description is now no longer clear; it has a value of its own]
2
  ;#1.description = "Boring"
2
  => "Boring"
2
  ;#42.description  
2
  => "Something special"
2
   
2
  @clearp foo.description
2
  Property #42.description cleared; value is now "Boring".
2
   [foo.description is now clear again]
2
  ;#1.description = ""

Syntax:   @disinherit <object> 
2
          @disinherit <object> [from <parent>]
2

2
Synonym:  @disown
2

2
This command is used to remove an unwanted child from an object you own.  If you owned said child, you could use @chparent; this command is to cover the other case, namely where you don't own the child.  
2

2
Both forms of this command chparent <object> to its grandparent, provided you own the parent.  The second form matches the string you supply for <object> against the list of children of the given <parent>.
2

2
Turning off the fertile bit (.f) for a particular object prevents others from creating children of it or chparenting to it (see `help @chmod').
2
Note also that, though the name might seem to indicate otherwise, this command does not change the ownership of any object.

If neither .<property>|.parent nor <code> is specified, just return <thing>.
2
If .<property> is named, return <thing>.<property>.  .parent returns parent(<thing>).

It is often the case in MOO programming that you will want to access the elements of a list individually, with each element stored in a separate variables.  This desire arises, for example, at the beginning of almost every MOO verb, since the arguments to all verbs are delivered all bunched together in a single list.  In such circumstances, you could write statements like these:
2

2
first = args[1];
2
second = args[2];
2
if (length(args) > 2)
2
  third = args[3];
2
else
2
  third = 0;
2
endif
2

2
This approach gets pretty tedious, both to read and to write, and it's prone to errors if you mistype one of the indices. Also, you often want to check whether or not any extra list elements were present, adding to the tedium.
2

2
MOO provides a special kind of assignment expression, called `scattering assignment' made just for cases such as these. A scattering assignment expression looks like this:
2

2
{<target>, ...} = <expr>
2

2
where each <target> describes a place to store elements of the list that results from evaluating <expr>. A <target> has one of the following forms:
2

2
`variable'
2
   This is the simplest target, just a simple variable; the list element in the corresponding position is assigned to the variable.  This is called a `required' target, since the assignment is required to put one of the list elements into the variable.
2

2
`?variable'
2
   This is called an `optional' target, since it doesn't always get assigned an element. If there are any list elements left over after all of the required targets have been accounted for (along with all of the other optionals to the left of this one), then this variable is treated like a required one and the list element in the corresponding position is assigned to the variable. If there aren't enough elements to assign one to this target, then no assignment is made to this variable, leaving it with whatever its previous value was.
2

2
`?variable' = `default-expr'
2
   This is also an optional target, but if there aren't enough list elements available to assign one to this target, the result of evaluating `default-expr' is assigned to it instead. Thus, `default-expr' provides a default value for the variable. The default value expressions are evaluated and assigned working from left to right -after- all of the other assignments have been performed.
2

2
`@variable'
2
   By analogy with the @ syntax in list construction, this variable is assigned a list of all of the `leftover' list elements in this part of the list after all of the other targets have been filled in. It is assigned the empty list if there aren't any elements left over. This is called a `rest' target, since it gets the rest of the elements. There may be at most one rest target in each scattering assignment expression.
2

2
If there aren't enough list elements to fill all of the required targets, or if there are more than enough to fill all of the required and optional targets but there isn't a rest target to take the leftover ones, then E_ARGS is raised.
2

2
Here are some examples of how this works.  Assume first that the verb me:foo() contains the following code:
2

2
b = c = e = 17;
2
{a, ?b, ?c = 8, @d, ?e = 9, f} = args;
2
return {a, b, c, d, e, f};
2

2
Then the following calls return the given values:
2

2
me:foo(1)                        error-->   E_ARGS
2
me:foo(1, 2)                     =>   {1, 17, 8, {}, 9, 2}
2
me:foo(1, 2, 3)                  =>   {1, 2, 8, {}, 9, 3}
2
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4)               =>   {1, 2, 3, {}, 9, 4}
2
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)            =>   {1, 2, 3, {}, 4, 5}
2
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)         =>   {1, 2, 3, {4}, 5, 6}
2
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)      =>   {1, 2, 3, {4, 5}, 6, 7}
2
me:foo(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)   =>   {1, 2, 3, {4, 5, 6}, 7, 8}
2

2
Using scattering assignment, the example at the begining of this section could be rewritten more simply, reliably, and readably:
2

2
{first, second, ?third = 0} = args;
2

2
It is good MOO programming style to use a scattering assignment at the top of nearly every verb, since it shows so clearly just what kinds of arguments the verb expects.

This command name can be changed by the `set_connection_option()' built-in function, or if $server_options.default_flush_command exists and is non-empty, that value is used. If it exists and -is- empty, then no flush command exists at all.

The MOO checkpoint is created by a UNIX system fork() call, which creates a separate process but with the same memory image as the running the MOO.  That process then writes that information into a database.
2

2
The act of calling this separate-but-equal process is intrinsically laggy because the MOO server memory is already saturated by the running version of the MOO.  Adding an equal size process to the mix results in heavy swapping between memory and harddrive.  It would therefore be considered wise not to run any processor or memory intensive MOOcode during checkpoint.
2

2
If you wish to alter any of your code to avoid executing during a checkpoint, you can check the value of $login.checkpoint_in_progress, which returns 1 during checkpoint and 0 otherwise.  This value is itself toggled by the verbs $sysobj:checkpoint_started and $sysobj:checkpoint_finished.

@denewt reverses the effects of @newt, removing the player from $login.newted, and if appropriate, $login.temporary_newts.

2
         @temp-newt <player> for <period>
2

2
The @newt command temporarily prevents logins on a given player.
2
It works by adding the player to $login.newted, and for @temp-newt, also adding the player and an end time to $login.temporary_newts.  $login will deny connection to any player in $login.newted, unless they are temporarily newted and their time has expired, in which case it will clean up---denewt them---and allow the connection attempt.  Use @denewt to reverse this.
2

2
You must give either the player's full name or its object number.
2
Also, this command does not let you @newt yourself.
2

2
Mail will be sent to $newt_log, listing the player's .all_connect_places and including any commentary you provide.  E.g.,
2

2
  @newt Twit  did real annoying things.
2

2
As with @toad and @programmer, there are messages that one may set
2

2
@newt  [%[$wiz.newt_msg]]
2
  Printed to everyone in the room in which the victim is being @newted.
2
  If you're worried about accidentally newting yourself in the process of
2
  setting this message, you can't (see above).
2

2
@newt_victim  [%[$wiz.newt_victim_msg]]
2
  Printed to the victim.  
2
  This is followed by $login:newt_registration_string().
2

2
See `help @toad' if you need something more drastic.
2

2
The @temp-newt variant of @newt permits you to specify a time period during which this player may not use the MOO.  Time units must be acceptable to $time_utils:parse_english_time_interval.

Database of places

------------------
2
i.e., places people have connected from.
2

2
  :add(sitename,player)
2
      records the fact that player connected from sitename.
2
  :load()
2
      clears the db and reloads all of the player connection info.
2

2
  .domain
2
      default domain for unqualified sitenames given to :add.
2
      
2
For each domain we keep a list of players and subdomains. 
2
For example, :add("doc.ic.ac.uk",#666) enters #666 on the lists for "doc.ic.ac.uk", and, if we have to create an entry for "doc.ic.ac.uk", we enter "doc" on the list for "ic.ac.uk", "ic" on the list for "ac.uk", etc....  In this case, :find("ic") will return the "ic.ac.uk" list if there is no other domain in $site_db starting with "ic".  Note that the "ic.ac.uk" list may contain both objects, i.e., namely players that have connected from the site "ic.ac.uk", and strings, i.e., subdomains of "ic.ac.uk" like "doc".
2

2
  :find_exact(string)    => player/subdomain list or $failed_match
2
  :find_all_keys(string) => list of all domains that begin with string
2
  :find_key     (string) => unique domain that begins with string, 
2
                            $ambiguous_match or $failed_match

2
The Site Blacklist
2
------------------
2
$login maintains three lists of hosts/domains to support player registration schemes and blocking of connections from highly untrusted hosts:
2

2
  .redlist   -- all connections from these sites are disabled 
2
  .blacklist -- player creation and guest logins are disabled
2
  .graylist  -- advisory list of potential trouble spots (putting a site on the
2
                .graylist merely annotates it in @net-who listings).
2
  .spooflist -- guests from these sites cannot use @request to request 
2
                a character
2

2
The lists are kept in a special format so it is highly recommended that you 
2
either use $wiz:@*list/@un*list or the following verbs to query/update the 
2
respective lists rather than bash them directly:
2

2
  $login:*listed     (host)              is host is on .*list?
2
  $login:*list_add   (domain or subnet)  add domain or subnet to .*list
2
  $login:*list_remove(domain or subnet)  remove domain or subnet from .*list
2

2
where `*' is one of `black', `red', `gray', or `spoof'.
2

2
There are also temporary versions of the above four lists, stored in associated $login.temporary_*list in the same format, except two additional bits of data are stored.  The time the temporary *listing started, and the duration that it will last.  In addition there exists:
2

2
  $login:*list_add_temp(domain or subnet, start time, duration)
2
  $login:*list_remove_temp(domain or subnet)
2

2
When the normal $login:*listed verb is called, both the regular *list and the temporary *list are checked.  If the host is on the temporary list, then the length of MOO up time since the start time is checked against the duration.  If expired, the host is removed from the temporary *list and a false value is returned (meaning that the host is not *listed).
2

2
One may either specify a domain name (e.g., "baz.edu") or a numeric IP address (e.g., "36.0.23.17").  Domain names match all hosts underneath that domain, so, e.g., puting "baz.edu" on a list effectively adds "x.bax.edu" for all x as well.  
2
Likewise, an incomplete numeric address, e.g., "128.42" will match that entire subnet, in this case all hosts whose IP numbers have the form "128.42.m.n" for arbitrary integers m and n.
2

2
One may also give a domain name containing a wildcard ("*"), e.g., "fritz*.baz.edu", in which case all hostnames matching in the sense of $string_utils:match_string() are considred to be on the list.  Wildcard matching should be avoided since it is more time-consuming.
2

2
It should be noted that, since there is no direct access to the domain name service from within the MOO, it is possible for a host to be blacklisted or redlisted via its domain name, and yet have someone be able to connect from that host (and, in the case of a blacklisted host, create a character) --- this can happen if the name service is down and connection_name() on that player thus has given the numeric IP address rather than the domain name.  Similarly, if you list a host by IP number alone, it will still be possible to get in via the site's domain name.  Thus to be completely assured of shutting out a site, you need to list it both by domain name and IP number.

Of course, wizards are allowed to @recycle anything at all.
2

2
There is, however, a block (in $player:recycle) against recycling actual players, i.e., descendants of $player that have the player flag set.  This is mainly to prevent stupid mistakes.  If, for some reason, you want to recycle a player, you need to @toad it first.

Syntax:  @untoad <object> [as <name>,<alias>,<alias>...]

2
Synonym: @detoad
2

2
Turns the object into a player.  
2
If the name/alias... specification is given, the object is also renamed.
2
In order for this to work, the object must be a nonplayer descendant of $player and the new object name (or the original name if none is given in the command line) must be available for use as a player name.  As with ordinary player @renaming, any aliases which are unavailable for use as player names are eliminated.
2

2
If the object is a descendant of $guest, then it becomes a new guest character.
2
Otherwise the object is chowned to itself.  In the latter case, it is advisable to check that the .password property has something nontrivial in it.
2

2
If the object is a descendant of $prog, then its .programmer flag is set.

Note that the .wizard flag is not set under any circumstances.

2
Resets the player flag of <player> (thus causing <player> to be booted), resets the .programmer and .wizard flags, chowns the player object to $hacker, and removes all of its names and aliases from $player_db.
2

2
You must give either the player's full name or its object number.
2
Also, this command does not let you @toad yourself.
2

2
In some cases you may wish to add the player's last connected site to the site graylist, blacklist or redlist --- see `help blacklist' --- in order to invoke various kinds of blocking on that site (e.g., if player creation is enabled, you may want to enter the player on the blacklist to keep him from immediately creating a new character).  Specifying one of the listnames `graylist', `blacklist' or `redlist' will do this.

         @chown <object>:<verbname> [to] <owner>
2
         @chown# <object>:<verbnumber> [to] <owner>
2

2
Changes the ownership of the indicated object, property or verb.
2

2
Verb ownership changes are fairly straightforward, being merely a matter of changing the verb_info() on a single verb. Referring to a verb isn't as straightforward since two verbs on the same object can have the same name. So, @chown# is provided where you can refer to a verb by it's 1-based index in the output of the verbs() builtin.
2

2
Changing an object ownership includes changing the ownership on all +c properties on that object.  Note that @chown will not change the ownership of any other properties, nor will it change verb ownerships.  Use @grant if you need to do a more complete ownership change.  The quota of the former owner is increased by one, as is the quota of the new owner decreased by one.
2

2
Changing a property ownership is truly hairy.  If the property is +c one shouldnot be doing this, unless it is to correct a past injustice which caused the property to be owned by the wrong player.  In the case of -c properties, the property ownership is changed on all descendent objects (currently, if +c instances of a -c property are found in the traversal of all of the descendants, these are not changed, being deemed sufficiently weird that they should be handled on a case-by-case basis...).
2

2
If there's any justice, a future version of the server will prevent occurrences of (1) +c properties being owned by someone other than the object owner (2) -c properties with different owners on descendant objects (3) -c properties that are +c on some descendants.

To add a domain or subnet to a *list only temporarily, include a `for <duration>' statement before any commentary.  The <duration> should be in english form such as 1 day or 1 month 2 weeks or 1 year 3 months 2 weeks 4 days.  No commas should separate increments in the duration.  See `help $time_utils:parse_english_time_interval' for more details.  If you are not temporarily *listing a domain or subnet, but are including a commentary, be sure that the commentary does not start with the word `for'.
2

2
If the given domain or subnet has subdomains/subsubnets that are already on the list, you will be prompted as to whether you want to remove them.  Note that adding an entry for a particular domain or subnet effectively adds all subdomains/subsubnets, so unless there's some reason for keeping an explicit entry for a particular subdomain, chances are you will indeed want to remove them.  One reason to keep an explicit entry for a subdomain would be if you intended to unlist the full domain later but wanted to be sure you didn't unlist the subdomain in the process.

        This will go through the @paranoid database and remove entries for players who have not connected within the past three days, and for those users who have turned off the @paranoid function.  Schedule is at 11pm PST.
2

2
$login:sample_lag
2
        This will provide an estimate of the CPU portion of what is normally called "lag"---that is, the delay between entering a command and having that command fulfilled.
2

2
$housekeeper:continuous
2
        If you wish to provide players with the ability to have individual items transported to a known starting location, use this verb.
2

2

2
Additionally, there are tasks that you don't have to start manually, but which get started by various actions in the MOO.
2

2
$network:add_queued_mail
2
        This indicates that there was a temporary failure to deliver email.  If this task is constantly in the queue, it is worth checking $network.queued_mail, deleting those which will never be delivered.  Queued mail does not expire.
2

2
$housekeeper:move_players_home
2
        This task is used to consolidate the tasks spawned by disconnecting players---they get a 5 minute grace period to log back in before they are moved back home.

Getting Started with your LambdaCore MOO
2
========================================
2

2
Thank you for choosing LambdaCore!
2

2
Initial Setup Notes
2
-------------------
2

2
The "welcome" screen, seen when a player connects.
2
  -- this is stored in $login.welcome_message
2

2
Do you want on-line character creation?
2
  -- this is stored in $login.create_enabled
2
     for more detailed information, edit $login:player_creation_enabled
2

2
Do you want to limit the number of players on the MOO at once?
2
  -- look at $login.max_connections
2
     the `connection_limit' message on $login is the message printed
2
     when this limit is reached.
2

2
Do you want a different default player class?
2
  -- set $player_class to a different value
2
     *do not* change $player
2

2
You should also set the following:
2
  $network.postmaster
2
    -- your email address, or the email address of the person who will 
2
       handle your email
2
  $network.site
2
    -- the machine your MOO is running on (e.g. "lambda.moo.mud.org")
2
  $network.port
2
    -- the port your MOO is running on (e.g. 8888)
2
  $network.MOO_Name
2
    -- the name of your MOO (e.g. "LambdaMOO")
2
  $site_db.domain
2
  -- this is set to the `domain' of your address
2
     (eg `foo.com' for `moo.foo.com')
2

2
If you compiled the server with open_network_connection() enabled (allowing the MOO to open up connections with other computers on the network), then you should set
2
  $network.active = 1
2
     This will enable @newpassword, @registerme, @password, @mailme, @netforward, and others to send mail from the MOO.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Setting Yourself Up
2
-------------------
2

2
Set a password for yourself.
2
  -- @password <new-password>
2

2
Set a description for yourself.
2
  -- @describe me as <anything>
2

2
Set a gender for yourself.
2
  -- @gender <gender>
2

2
There are, also, a large number of messages you can set on yourself.  Setting them will enhance the virtual reality.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
About Guests
2
------------
2

2
To make a new Guest character:
2
  -- @make-guest <guestname>
2
     will make a new guest with the name you specify with `_Guest' appended
2
     and some other standard but useful aliases
2

2
This is the easiest way to make Guest characters.  The most important things to remember about Guests, if you want to make them yourself, are:
2
  -- make them owned by nonwizards, and not owned by themselves
2
  -- make sure they've got .password == 0, and that .password is nonclear
2
  -- at least one Guest must always be named `Guest'; this can be an alias
2

2
To set the default description and gender for a guest:
2
  -- set .default_description to the description the guest should start with
2
  -- set .default_gender to the gender the guest should start with
2
  -- remember to set .description and .gender too, for the guest's first use
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Adding to the Newspaper
2
-----------------------
2

2
The newspaper is a special mailing list.  To add a post to the newspaper, send mail to it (as *News or $news), and then note the number of your post (let's call it <x> and:
2
  -- @addnews <x> to *News
2
... in general, `@addnews $ to *News' will work as well.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Quota
2
-----
2

2
By default, LambdaCore runs with byte-based quota, an in-DB quota system, limiting users by total database space as opposed to total objects.  You'll need to do two things:
2
  -- decide on the default quota:
2
     ;$byte_quota_utils.default_quota[1] = <a number of bytes>
2
  -- start the measurement task; see `help routine_tasks' for more information (Note: this help topic contains information about more than just the quota task; it should be read regardless of how quota is set).
2

2
If you prefer the quota system documented in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual, directly supported by the server, you can enable object-based quota:
2
  -- set $quota_utils to $object_quota_utils
2

2
It's best that you make this switch before users start, because converting existing users is an awkward (and inherently arbitrary and political) move.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Making Programmers
2
------------------
2

2
The command to turn someone into a programmer is `@programmer'  Its syntax is `@programmer <user>'.  For example:
2
  -- @programmer Haakon
2
The `@programmer' verb will prompt you if the user isn't set up with a description and a gender.
2

2
No code to automatically grant programmer bits is included with LambdaCore.
2

2
Making Wizards
2
--------------
2

2
THINK CAREFULLY.
2

2
Be very careful before giving someone a wizard bit.  That person can do gross damage to your database, and fixable but serious damage to the machine it runs on.  That person can quite possibly open outbound network connections from your machine, and thus commit acts for which your host system will be blamed.  That person can ruin your MOO's as-yet-untarnished reputation.
2

2
Wizards have technical power, the ability to change anything within the database, to create anything within the database.  Be careful with the idea of a `Social Wizard' -- a nontechnical person holding a wizard bit is fairly likely to, at some point, accidentally do something destructive.  It's a good idea not to socialize as your wizard character, for the same reason, to make it less likely to be accidentally destructive.
2

2
That said, in general you don't turn an existing character into a wizard, you make a -new- character to be the wizard.  This is because the existing character probably owns code and objects which could be destructive if suddenly made wizardly; it's a good security measure to make a fresh player.  So, to make a fresh player:
2
  -- @make-player (see `help @make-player' for more information)
2
     this will make you a new player. for this example, #123
2

2
To make #123 a wizard:
2
  -- @programmer #123
2
     (a nonprogrammer wizard is a truly strange beast)
2
  -- ;#123.wizard = 1;
2
  -- @chparent #123 to $wiz
2
  -- ;#123.public_identity = <the player's nonwizard character's object number>
2

Wizard Utilities
2
----------------
2
The following functions are substitutes for various server builtins.
2
Anytime one feel tempted to use one of the expressions on the right,
2
use the corresponding one on the left instead.  This will take care
2
of various things that the server (for whatever reason) does not handle.
2

2
:set_programmer(object)             object.programmer = 1;
2
    chparent object to $prog
2
    send mail to $prog_log
2

2
:set_player(object[,nochown])       set_player_flag(object,1);
2
    set player flag, 
2
    add name/aliases to $player_db,
2
    and maybe do a self chown.
2

2
:unset_player(object[,newowner])    set_player_flag(object,0);
2
    unset player flag,
2
    remove name/aliases from $player_db
2
    chown to newowner if given
2

2
:set_owner(object, newowner)        object.owner = newowner;
2
    change ownership on object
2
    change ownership on all +c properties
2
    juggle .ownership_quotas
2

2
:set_property_owner(object, property, newowner[, suspend-ok])
2
    change owner on a given property
2
    if this is a -c property, we change the owner on all descendants
2
    for which this is also a -c property.
2
    Polite protest if property is +c and newowner != object.owner.
2

2
:set_property_flags(object, property, flags[, suspend-ok])
2
    change the permissions on a given property and propagate these to 
2
    *all descendants*.  property ownership is changed on descendants 
2
    where necessary.

Syntax:  match (STR <subject>, STR <pattern> [, <case-matters>])  => LIST
2
         rmatch (STR <subject>, STR <pattern> [, <case-matters>])  => LIST
2

2
The function `match()' (`rmatch()') searches for the first (last) occurrence of the regular expression <pattern> in the string <subject>.  If <pattern> is syntactically malformed, then E_INVARG is raised. The process of matching can in some cases consume a great deal of memory in the server; should this memory consumption become excessive, then the matching process is aborted and E_QUOTA is raised.
2

2
If no match is found, the empty list is returned; otherwise, these functions return a list containing information about the match (see below).  By default, the search ignores upper/lower case distinctions.  If <case-matters> is provided and true, then case is treated as significant in all comparisons.
2

2
The list that `match()' (`rmatch()') returns contains the details about the match made.  The list is in the form:
2

2
     {<start>, <end>, <replacements>, <subject>}
2

2
where <start> is the index in STRING of the beginning of the match, <end> is the index of the end of the match, <replacements> is a list described below, and <subject> is the same string that was given as the first argument to the `match()' or `rmatch()'.
2

2
The <replacements> list is always nine items long, each item itself being a list of two numbers, the start and end indices in <subject> matched by some parenthesized sub-pattern of <pattern>.  The first item in <replacements> carries the indices for the first parenthesized sub-pattern, the second item carries those for the second sub-pattern, and so on.  If there are fewer than nine parenthesized sub-patterns in <pattern>, or if some sub-pattern was not used in the match, then the corresponding item in <replacements> is the list {0, -1}.  See the discussion of `%)' in `help regular-expressions', for more information on parenthesized sub-patterns.
2

2
   match("foo", "f*o")          =>  {1, 2, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foo"}
2
   match("foo", "fo*")          =>  {1, 3, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foo"}
2
   match("foobar", "o*b")       =>  {2, 4, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foobar"}
2
   rmatch("foobar", "o*b")      =>  {4, 4, {{0, -1}, ...}, "foobar"}
2
   match("foobar", "f%(o*%)b")  =>  {1, 4, {{2, 3}, {0, -1}, ...}, "foobar"}

Syntax:  substitute (STR <template>, LIST <subs>)  => STR
2

2
Performs a standard set of substitutions on the string <template>, using the information contained in <subs>, returning the resulting, transformed <template>.  <Subs> should be a list like those returned by `match()' or `rmatch()' when the match succeeds.
2

2
In <template>, the strings `%1' through `%9' will be replaced by the text matched by the first through ninth parenthesized sub-patterns when `match()' or `rmatch()' was called.  The string `%0' in <template> will be replaced by the text matched by the pattern as a whole when `match()' or `rmatch()' was called. The string '%%' will be replaced by a single '%' sign. If '%' appears in <template> followed by any other character, E_INVARG will be raised.
2

2
     subs = match("*** Welcome to LambdaMOO!!!", "%(%w*%) to %(%w*%)");
2
     substitute("I thank you for your %1 here in %2.", subs)
2
             =>   "I thank you for your Welcome here in LambdaMOO."

Syntax:  sqrt (FLOAT <x>)  => FLOAT

Syntax:  server_log (STR <message> [, <is-error>])  => none
2

2
The text in <message> is sent to the server log.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.  If <is-error> is provided and true, then <message> is marked in the server log as an error.

Syntax:  pass (<arg>, ...)   => value
2

2
Often, it is useful for a child object to define a verb that *augments* the behavior of a verb on its parent object. For example, the root object (an ancestor of every other object) defines a :description() verb that simply returns the value of `this.description'; this verb is used by the implementation of the `look' command. In many cases, a programmer would like the description of some object to include some non-constant part; for example, a sentence about whether or not the object was `awake' or `sleeping'.  This sentence should be added onto the end of the normal description.  The programmer would like to have a means of calling the normal `description' verb and then appending the sentence onto the end of that description.  The function `pass()' is for exactly such situations.
2

2
`Pass()' calls the verb with the same name as the current verb but as defined on the parent of the object that defines the current verb.  The arguments given to the called verb are the ones given to pass() and the returned value of the called verb is returned from the call to pass(). The initial value of `this' in the called verb is the same as in the calling verb.
2

2
Thus, in the example above, the child-object's :description() verb might have the following implementation:
2

2
    return pass(@args) + "  It is " + (this.awake ? "awake." | "sleeping.");
2

2
That is, it calls its parent's :description() verb and then appends to the result a sentence whose content is computed based on the value of a property on the object.
2

In the above example, `pass()' would have worked just as well, since :description() is not normally given any arguements.  However, it is a good idea to get into the habit of using `pass(@args)' rather than `pass(args[1])' or `pass()' even if the verb being pass()ed to is already known to take a set number of arguments or none at all.  For one thing, though the args may be irrelevant to the code that you've written, it may be that the corresponding verb on the parent has been rewritten to take additional arguments, in which case you will want your verb to continue to work...

Syntax:  open_network_connection (<value>, ... [, <use_ipv6>, <listener>])   => obj
2

2
Establishes a network connection to the place specified by the arguments and more-or-less pretends that a new, normal player connection has been established from there.  The new connection, as usual, will not be logged in initially and will have a negative object number associated with it for use with `read()', `notify()', and `boot_player()'.  This object number is the value returned by this function.
2

2
If the programmer is not a wizard or if the `OUTBOUND_NETWORK' compilation option was not used in building the server, then `E_PERM' is raised.  If the network connection cannot be made for some reason, then other errors will be returned, depending upon the particular network implementation in use.
2

2
For the TCP/IP network implementations (the only ones as of this writing that support outbound connections), there must be at least two arguments, a string naming a host (possibly using the numeric Internet syntax) and an integer specifying a TCP port.  If a connection cannot be made because the host does not exist, the port does not exist, the host is not reachable or refused the connection, `E_INVARG' is raised.  If the connection cannot be made for other reasons, including resource limitations, then `E_QUOTA' is raised.
2

2
An optional third agument can be supplied indicating that the connection should be created on the destination's IPv6 interface rather than IPv4.
2

2
Finally, an optional fourth argument may be supplied, `listener' must be an object, whose listening verbs will be called at appropriate points.  See the description in `listen()' for more details.
2

2
The outbound connection process involves certain steps that can take quite a long time, during which the server is not doing anything else, including responding to user commands and executing MOO tasks.  See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details about how the server limits the amount of time it will wait for these steps to successfully complete.
2

2
It is worth mentioning one tricky point concerning the use of this function.  Since the server treats the new connection pretty much like any normal player connection, it will naturally try to parse any input from that connection as commands in the usual way.  To prevent this treatment, you should use `set_connection_option()' to set the `hold-input' option true on the connection.

2
Syntax:  connection_name (obj <player> [, <method>])   => str
2

2
Returns a network-specific string identifying the connection being used by the given player.  If the programmer is not a wizard and not <player>, then E_PERM is raised.  If <player> is not currently connected, then E_INVARG is raised.
2

2
For the TCP/IP networking configurations, for in-bound connections, the string contains the resolved DNS hostname of the connection.
2

2
If <method> is set to 1, the string will always contain the numeric IP address of the connection.
2

2
If <method> is set to 2, the string will contain the full legacy connection_name string with the form:
2

2
  "port <lport> from <host>, port <port>"
2

2
where <lport> is the listening port on which the connection arrived, <host> is either the name or decimal TCP address of the host to which the connection was opened, and <port> is the decimal TCP port of the connection on that host.

2
Syntax:  shutdown ([STR <message>])   => none

Requests that the server shut itself down at its next opportunity.  Before doing so, the given <message> is printed to all connected players.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.

2
Syntax:  dump_database ()   => none
2

2
Requests that the server checkpoint the database at its next opportunity.  It is not normally necessary to call this function; the server automatically checkpoints the database at regular intervals; see the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.

2
Syntax:  memory_usage ()   => list
2

2
On some versions of the server, this returns statistics concerning the server
2
consumption of system memory.  The result is a list of lists, each in the
2
following format:
2

2
    {<block-size>, <nused>, <nfree>}
2

2
where <block-size> is the size in bytes of a particular class of memory
2
fragments, <nused> is the number of such fragments currently in use in the
2
server, and <nfree> is the number of such fragments that have been reserved
2
for use but are currently free.
2

2
On servers for which such statistics are not available, `memory_usage()'
2
returns `{}'.  The compilation option `USE_SYSTEM_MALLOC' controls
2
whether or not statistics are available; if the option is provided, statistics
2
are not available.

2
Syntax:  reset_max_object ()   => none
2

2
The server's idea of the highest object number ever used is changed to be the highest object number of a currently-existing object, thus allowing reuse of any higher numbers that refer to now-recycled objects.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.
2

This operation is intended for use in making new versions of the LambdaCore database from the then-current LambdaMOO database, and other similar situations.  Its use requires great care.

2
Syntax:  renumber (OBJ <object>)   => OBJ
2

2
The object number of the object currently numbered <object> is changed to be the least nonnegative object number not currently in use and the new object number is returned.  If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised. If there are no unused nonnegative object numbers less than <object>, then <object> is returned and no changes take place.
2

2
The references to <object> in the parent/children and location/contents hierarchies are updated to use the new object number, and any verbs, properties and/or objects owned by <object> are also changed to be owned by the new object number.  The latter operation can be quite time consuming if the database is large.  No other changes to the database are performed; in particular, no object references in property values or verb code are updated.

2
Syntax:  server_version ()   => str
2

2
Returns a string giving the version number of the MOO server in the following
2
format:
2

2
    "<major>.<minor>.<release>"
2

2
where <major>, <minor>, and <release> are all decimal numbers.
2

2
The major version number changes very slowly, only when existing MOO code might
2
stop working, due to an incompatible change in the syntax or semantics of the
2
programming language, or when an incompatible change is made to the database
2
format.
2

2
The minor version number changes more quickly, whenever an upward-compatible
2
change is made in the programming language syntax or semantics.  The most
2
common cause of this is the addition of a new kind of expression, statement, or
2
built-in function.
2

2
The release version number changes as frequently as bugs are fixed in the
2
server code.  Changes in the release number indicate changes that should only
2
be visible to users as bug fixes, if at all.

Syntax:  output_delimiters (OBJ <player>)   => LIST
2

2
Returns a list of two strings, the current "output prefix" and "output suffix" for <player>.  If <player> does not have an active network connection, then E_INVARG is raised.  If either string is currently undefined, the value `""' is used instead.  See the discussion of the `PREFIX' and `SUFFIX' commands in the LambdaMOO Programmers Manual for more information about the output prefix and suffix.

2
Syntax:  callers ([include-line-numbers])   => list
2

2
Returns information on each of the verbs and built-in functions currently waiting to resume execution in the current task.  When one verb or function calls another verb or function, execution of the caller is temporarily suspended, pending the called verb or function returning a value.  At any given time, there could be several such pending verbs and functions: the one that called the currently executing verb, the verb or function that called that one, and so on.  The result of `callers()' is a list, each element of which gives information about one pending verb or function in the following format:
2

2
  {<this>, <verb-name>, <programmer>, <verb-loc>, <player>, <line-number>}
2

2
For verbs, <this> is the initial value of the variable `this' in that verb, <verb-name> is the name used to invoke that verb, <programmer> is the player with whose permissions that verb is running, <verb-loc> is the object on which that verb is defined, and <player> is the initial value of the variable `player' in that verb, and <line-number> indicates which line of the verb's code is executing. The <line-number> element is included only if the `include-line-numbers' argument was provided and is true.
2

2
For functions, <this>, <programmer>, and <verb-loc> are all #-1, <verb-name> is the name of the function, and <line-number> is an index used internally to determine the current state of the built-in function. The simplest correct test for a built-in function entry is
2

2
(VERB-LOC == #-1 && PROGRAMMER == #-1 && VERB-NAME != "")
2

2

2
The first element of the list returned by `callers()' gives information on the verb that called the currently-executing verb, the second element describes the verb that called that one, and so on.  The last element of the list describes the first verb called in this task.

Syntax:  kill_task (INT <task-id>)   => none
2

2
Removes the task with the given <task-id> from the queue of waiting tasks. If the programmer is not the owner of that task and not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.  If there is no task on the queue with the given <task-id>, then E_INVARG is raised.
36
5

10
2
Syntax:  queued_tasks ()   => LIST
2

2
Returns information on each of the background tasks (i.e., forked, suspended, or reading)  owned by the programmer (or, if the programmer is a wizard, all queued tasks). The returned value is a list of lists, each of which encodes certain information about a particular queued task in the following format:
2

2
    {<task-id>, <start-time>, <ticks>, <clock-id>,
2
     <programmer>, <verb-loc>, <verb-name>, <line>, <this>, <task-size>}
2

2
where <task-id> is a numeric identifier for this queued task, <start-time> is the time after which this task will begin execution (in `time()' format), <ticks> is the number of ticks this task will have when it starts (always 20,000 now, though this is changeable. This makes this value obsolete and no longer interesting), <clock-id> is a number whose value is no longer interesting, <programmer> is the permissions with which this task will begin execution (and also the player who "owns" this task), <verb-loc> is the object on which the verb that forked this task was defined at the time, <verb-name> is that name of that verb, <line> is the number of the first line of the code in that verb that this task will execute, and <this> is the value of the variable `this' in that verb. For reading tasks, <start-time> is `-1'.  <task-size> is in bytes, and is the size of memory in use by the task for local variables, stack frames, etc.
2

2
The <ticks> and <clock-id> fields are now obsolete and are retained only for backward-compatibility reasons.  They may disappear in a future version of the server.

2
Syntax:  read ([OBJ <conn> [, non-blocking]])   => STR
2

2
Reads and returns a line of input from the connection <conn> (or, if not provided, from the player that typed the command that initiated the current task). If <non-blocking> is false or not provided, this function suspends the current task, resuming it when there is input available to be read. If <non-blocking> is provided and true, this function never suspends the calling task; if there is no input currently available for input, `read()' simply returns 0 immediately.
2

2
If <conn> is provided, then the programmer must either be a wizard or the owner of <conn>, if <conn> is not provided, then `read()' may only be called by a wizard and only in the task that was last spawned by a command from the connection in question. Otherwise, E_PERM is raised. If the given <conn> is not currently connected and has no pending lines of input, or if the connection is closed while a task is waiting for input but before any lines of input are received, then `read()' raises E_INVARG.
2

2
The restriction on the use of `read()' without any arguments preserves the following simple invariant: if input is being read from a player, it is for the task started by the last command that the player typed. This invariant adds responsibility to the programmer, however. If your program calls another verb before doing a `read()', then either that verb must not suspend, or else you must arrange that no commands will be read from the connection in the meantime. The most straightforward way to do this is to call
2

2
  set_connection_option(<conn>, "hold-input", 1)
2

2
before any task suspension could happen, then make all of your calls to `read()' and other code that might suspend, and finally call
2

2
  set_connection_option(<conn>, "hold-input", 0)
2

2
to allow commands once again to be read and interpreted normally.

2
Syntax:  suspend ([INT <seconds>])   => value
2

2
Suspends the current task, and resumes it after at least <seconds> seconds. (If <seconds> is not provided, the task is suspended indefinitely; such a task can only be resumed by use of the `resume()' function.) When the task is resumed, it will have a full quota of ticks and seconds.  This function is useful for programs that run for a long time or require a lot of ticks.  If <seconds> is negative, then E_INVARG is raised. `Suspend()' returns zero unless it was resumed via `resume()' in which case it returns the second argument given to that function.
2

2
In some sense, this function forks the `rest' of the executing task.  However, there is a major difference between the use of `suspend(<seconds>)' and the use of the `fork (<seconds>)'.  The `fork' statement creates a new task (a "forked task") while the currently-running task still goes on to completion, but a `suspend()' suspends the currently-running task (thus making it into a "suspended task").  This difference may be best explained by the following examples, in which one verb calls another:
2

2
    .program   #0:caller_A
2
    #0.prop = 1;
2
    #0:callee_A();
2
    #0.prop = 2;
2
    .
2

2
    .program   #0:callee_A
2
    fork(5)
2
      #0.prop = 3;
2
    endfork
2
    .
2

2
    .program   #0:caller_B
2
    #0.prop = 1;
2
    #0:callee_B();
2
    #0.prop = 2;
2
    .
2

2
    .program   #0:callee_B
2
    suspend(5);
2
    #0.prop = 3;
2
    .
2

2
Consider `#0:caller_A', which calls `#0:callee_A'.  Such a task would assign 1 to `#0.prop', call `#0:callee_A', fork a new task, return to `#0:caller_A', and assign 2 to `#0.prop', ending this task.  Five seconds later, if the forked task had not been killed, then it would begin to run; it would assign 3 to `#0.prop' and then stop.  So, the final value of `#0.prop' (i.e., the value after more than 5 seconds) would be 3.
2

2
Now consider `#0:caller_B', which calls `#0:callee_B' instead of `#0:callee_A'.  This task would assign 1 to `#0.prop', call `#0:callee_B', and suspend.  Five seconds later, if the suspended task had not been killed, then it would resume; it would assign 3 to `#0.prop', return to `#0:caller', and assign 2 to `#0.prop', ending the task. So, the final value of `#0.prop' (i.e., the value after more than 5 seconds) would be 2.
2

2
A suspended task, like a forked task, can be described by the `queued_tasks()' function and killed by the `kill_task()' function. Suspending a task does not change its task id.  A task can be suspended again and again by successive calls to `suspend()'.
2

2
Once `suspend()' has been used in a particular task, then the `read()' function will always raise E_PERM in that task.  For more details, see the description of `read()'.
2

2
By default, there is no limit to the number of tasks any player may suspend, but such a limit can be imposed from within the database. See the chapter in the LambdaMOO Programmers Manual on server assumptions about the database for details.

2
Syntax:  caller_perms ()   => obj
2

2
Returns the permissions in use by the verb that called the currently-executing

2
is the first verb called in a command or server task), then
2
`caller_perms()' returns `#-1'.

2
Syntax:  set_task_perms (OBJ <player>)   => none

2
Changes the permissions with which the currently-executing verb is running to be those of <player>.  If <player> is not of type OBJ, then E_INVARG is raised.  If the programmer is neither <player> nor a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.
2

2
Note: This does not change the owner of the currently-running verb, only the permissions of this particular invocation.  It is used in verbs owned by wizards to make themselves run with lesser (usually non-wizard) permissions.
36

2
Syntax:  eval (str <string>)   => list
2

2
The MOO-code compiler processes <string> as if it were to be the program associated with some verb and, if no errors are found, that fictional verb is invoked.  If the programmer is not, in fact, a programmer, then E_PERM is raised.  The normal result of calling `eval()' is a two element list. The first element is true if there were no compilation errors and false otherwise.  The second element is either the result returned from the fictional verb (if there were no compilation errors) or a list of the compiler's error messages (otherwise).
2

2
When the fictional verb is invoked, the various built-in variables have values as shown below:
2

2
    player    the same as in the calling verb
2
    this      #-1
2
    caller    the same as the initial value of `this' in the calling verb
2

    args      {}

    prepstr   ""

    iobjstr   ""

2
Syntax:  boot_player (obj <player>)   => none
2

2
Immediately terminates any currently-active connection to the given <player>.  The connection will not actually be closed until the currently-running task returns or suspends, but all MOO functions (such as notify(), connected_players(), and the like) immediately behave as if the connection no longer exists. If the programmer is not either a wizard or the same as <player>, then `E_PERM' is returned.  If there is no currently-active connection to <player>, then this function does nothing.
2

2
If there was a currently-active connection, then the following verb call is made when the connection is actually closed:
2

2
$user_disconnected(player)
2

2
It is not an error if this verb does not exist; the corresponding call is simply skipped.
36

7
2
Syntax:  notify (OBJ conn, STR string [, no-flush]) => 0 or 1
2

2
Enqueues <string> for output (on a line by itself) on the connection <conn>. If the programmer is not <conn> or a wizard, then E_PERM is raised. If <conn> is not a currently-active connection, then this function does nothing. Output is normally written to connections only between tasks, not during execution.
2

2
The server will not queue an arbitrary amount of output for a connection; the `MAX_QUEUED_OUTPUT' compilation option (in `options.h') controls the limit. When an attempt is made to enqueue output that would take the server over its limit, it first tries to write as much output as possible to the connection without having to wait for the other end. If that doesn't result in the new output being able to fit in the queue, the server starts throwing away the oldest lines in the queue until the new output will fit. The server remembers how many lines of output it has `flushed' in this way and, when next it can succeed in writing anything to the connection, it first writes a line like `>> Network buffer overflow; X lines of output to you have been lost <<' where <X> is the number of of flushed lines.
2

2
If <no-flush> is provided and true, then `notify()' never flushes any output from the queue; instead it immediately returns false. `Notify()' otherwise always returns true.

2
Syntax:  connected_seconds (obj <player>)   => int

              idle_seconds (obj <player>)   => int

2
These functions return the number of seconds that the currently-active connection to <player> has existed and been idle, respectively.  If <player> is not the object number of a player object with a currently-active connection, then E_INVARG is raised.
36

Syntax:  connected_players ([include-all])   => LIST

2
Syntax:  set_player_flag (OBJ <object>, <value>)   => none
2

2
Confers or removes the ``player object'' status of the given <object>, depending upon the truth value of <value>.  If <object> is not valid, E_INVARG is raised.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.
2

2
If <value> is true, then <object> gains (or keeps) "player object" status: it will be an element of the list returned by `players()', the expression `is_player(<object>)' will return true, and users can connect to <object> by name when they log into the server.
2

2
If <value> is false, the <object> loses (or continues to lack) "player object" status: it will not be an element of the list returned by `players()', the expression `is_player(<object>)' will return false, and users cannot connect to <object> by name when they log into the server.  In addition, if a user is connected to <object> at the time that it loses ``player object'' status, then that connection is immediately broken, just as if `boot_player(<object>)' had been called (see the description of `boot_player()' below).

2
     set_verb_code (OBJ <object>, STR <verb-name>, LIST <code>)   => LIST
2

2
These functions get and set (respectively) the MOO-code program associated with the verb named <verb-name> on <object>.  The program is represented as a list of strings, one for each line of the program; this is the kind of value returned by `verb_code()' and expected as the third argument to `set_verb_code()'.  For `verb_code()', the expressions in the returned code are usually written with the minimum-necessary parenthesization; if <fully-paren> is true, then all expressions are fully parenthesized. Also for `verb_code()', the lines in the returned code are usually not indented at all; if <indent> is true, each line is indented to better show the nesting of statements.
2

2
If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb named <verb-name>, then E_VERBNF is raised.  If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the verb in question, then `verb_code()' (`set_verb_code()') raises E_PERM.  If the programmer is not, in fact, a programmer, then E_PERM is raised.
2

2
For `set_verb_code()', the result is a list of strings, the error messages generated by the MOO-code compiler during processing of <code>.  If the list is non-empty, then `set_verb_code()' did not install <code>; the program associated with the verb in question is unchanged.

Syntax:  add_verb (obj <object>, list <info>, list <args>)   => int
2

2
Defines a new verb on the given <object>.  The new verb's owner, permission bits and name(s) are given by <info> in the same format as is returned by `verb_info()'.  The new verb's direct-object, preposition, and indirect-object specifications are given by <args> in the same format as is returned by `verb_args()'.  The new verb initially has the empty program associated with  it; this program does nothing but return an unspecified value.  
2

2
If <object> is not valid, or <info> does not specify a valid owner and well-formed permission bits and verb names, or <args> is not a legitimate syntax specification, then `E_INVARG' is raised.  If the programmer does not have write permission on <object> or if the owner specified by <info> is not the programmer and the programmer is not a wizard, then `E_PERM' is raised.  Otherwise, this function returns a positive integer representing the new verb's index in this object's `verbs()' list.

2
These two functions get and set (respectively) the direct-object, preposition, and indirect-object specifications for the verb named <verb-name> on the given <object>.  If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb named <verb-name>, then E_VERBNF is raised.  If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the verb in question, then `verb_args()' (`set_verb_args()') raises E_PERM.  Verb args specifications have the following form:
2

2
    {<dobj>, <prep>, <iobj>}
2

2
where <dobj> and <iobj> are strings drawn from the set `"this"', `"none"', and `"any"', and <prep> is a string that is either `"none"', `"any"', or one of the prepositional phrases listed much earlier in the description of verbs in the first chapter.  This is the kind of value returned by `verb_info()' and expected as the third argument to `set_verb_info()'.  Note that for `set_verb_args()', <prep> must be only one of the prepositional phrases, not (as is shown in that table) a set of such phrases separated by `/' characters.  `Set_verb_args()' raises E_INVARG if any of the <dobj>, <prep>, or <iobj> strings is illegal.

These two functions get and set (respectively) the owner, permission bits, and name(s) for the verb named <verb-name> on the given <object>.  If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  If <object> does not define a verb named <verb-name>, then E_VERBNF is raised. If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the verb in question, then `verb_info()' (`set_verb_info()') raises E_PERM.  Verb info has the following form:
2

2
    {<owner>, <perms>, <names>}
2

2
where <owner> is an object, <perms> is a string containing only characters from the set `r', `w', `x', and `d', and <names> is a string.  This is the kind of value returned by `verb_info()' and expected as the third argument to `set_verb_info()'. The latter function raises E_INVARG if <owner> is not valid, if <perms> contains any illegal characters, or if <names> is the empty string or consists entirely of spaces; it raises E_PERM if <owner> is not the programmer and the programmer is not a wizard.

If the programmer does not have write permission on <object>, then E_PERM is raised.

If <object> is not valid or <object> already has a property named <prop-name> or <info> does not specify a legitimate owner and permission bits, then E_INVARG is raised.

These two functions get and set (respectively) the owner and permission bits for the property named <prop-name> on the given <object>.  If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  If <object> has no non-built-in property named <prop-name>, then E_PROPNF is raised.  If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the property in question, then `property_info()' (`set_property_info()') raises E_PERM.  Property info has the following form:
2

2
    {<owner>, <perms> [, new-name]}
2

2
where <owner> is an object and <perms> is a string containing only characters from the set `r', `w', and `c', and <new-name> is a string; <new-name> is never part of the value returned by `property_info()', but it may optionally be given as part of the value provided to `set_property_info()'.  This list is the kind of value returned by `property_info()' and expected as the third argument to `set_property_info()'; the latter function raises E_INVARG if <owner> is not valid or <perms> contains any illegal characters, or, when <new-name> is given, if <prop-name> is not defined directly on <object> or <new-name> names an existing property defined on <object> or any of its ancestors or descendants.

Syntax:  move (OBJ <what>, OBJ <where>)   => none
2

2
Changes <what>'s location to be <where>.  This is a complex process because a number of permissions checks and notifications must be performed. The actual movement takes place as described in the following paragraphs.
2

2
<what> should be a valid object and <where> should be either a valid object or `#-1' (denoting a location of 'nowhere'); otherwise E_INVARG is raised.  The programmer must be either the owner of <what> or a wizard; otherwise, E_PERM is raised.
2

2
If <where> is a valid object, then the verb-call
2

2
    <where>:accept(<what>)
2

2
is performed before any movement takes place.  If the verb returns a false value and the programmer is not a wizard, then <where> is considered to have refused entrance to <what>; `move()' raises E_NACC.  If <where> does not define an `accept' verb, then it is treated as if it defined one that always returned false.
2

2
If moving <what> into <where> would create a loop in the containment hierarchy (i.e., <what> would contain itself, even indirectly), then E_RECMOVE is raised instead.
2

2
The `location' property of <what> is changed to be <where>, and the `contents' properties of the old and new locations are modified appropriately.  Let <old-where> be the location of <what> before it was moved.  If <old-where> is a valid object, then the verb-call
2

2
    <old-where>:exitfunc(<what>)
2

2
is performed and its result is ignored; it is not an error if <old-where> does not define a verb named `exitfunc'.  Finally, if <where> and <what> are still valid objects, and <where> is still the location of <what>, then the verb-call
2

2
    <where>:enterfunc(<what>)
2

2
is performed and its result is ignored; again, it is not an error if <where> does not define a verb named `enterfunc'.

Syntax:  max_object ()   => obj
2

2
Returns the largest object number yet assigned to a created object.  Note that

The next object created will be assigned the object number one larger than the
2
value of `max_object()'.

2
Syntax:  recycle (OBJ <object>)   => none
2

2
The given <object> is destroyed, irrevocably.  The programmer must either own <object> or be a wizard; otherwise, E_PERM is raised.  If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  The children of <object> are reparented to the parent of <object>.  Before <object> is recycled, each object in its contents is moved to `#-1' (implying a call to <object>'s `exitfunc' verb, if any) and then <object>'s `recycle' verb, if any, is called with no arguments.
2

2
After <object> is recycled, if the owner of the former object has a property named `ownership_quota' and the value of that property is a number, then `recycle()' treats that value as a "quota" and increments it by one, storing the result back into the `ownership_quota' property.

Syntax:  chparent (obj <object>, obj <new-parent>)   => none
2

2
Changes the parent of <object> to be <new-parent>. If <object> is not valid, or if <new-parent> is neither valid nor equal to #-1, then E_INVARG is raised. If the programmer is neither a wizard or the owner of <object>, or if <new-parent> is not fertile (i.e., its `f' bit is not set) and the programmer is neither the owner of <new-parent> nor a wizard, then `E_PERM' is raised.  If <new-parent> is equal to <object> or one of its current ancestors, E_RECMOVE is raised. If <object> or one of its descendants defines a property with the same name as one defined either on <new-parent> or on one of its ancestors, then `E_INVARG' is returned.
2

2
Changing an object's parent can have the effect of removing some properties from and adding some other properties to that object and all of its descendants (i.e., its children and its children's children, etc.).  Let <common> be the nearest ancestor that <object> and <new-parent> have in common before the parent of <object> is changed.  Then all properties defined by ancestors of <object> under <common> (that is, those ancestors of <object> that are in turn descendants of <common>) are removed from <object> and all of its descendants.  All properties defined by <new-parent> or its ancestors under <common> are added to <object> and all of its descendants.  As with `create()', the newly-added properties are given the same permission bits as they have on <new-parent>, the owner of each added property is either the owner of the object it's added to (if the `c' permissions bit is set) or the owner of that property on <new-parent>, and the value of each added property is "clear"; see the description of the built-in function `clear_property()' for details.  All properties that are not removed or added in the reparenting process are completely unchanged.
2

2
If <new-parent> is equal to #-1, then <object> is given no parent at all; it becomes a new root of the parent/child hierarchy. In this case, all formerly inherited properties on <object> are simply removed.
36

2
Syntax:  create (obj <parent> [, obj <owner>])   => obj
2

2
Creates and returns a new object whose parent is <parent> and whose owner is as described below.  Either the given <parent> object must be fertile (i.e., its `f' bit must be set) or else the programmer must own <parent> or be a wizard; otherwise `E_PERM' is raised. `E_PERM' is also raised if <owner> is provided and not the same as the programmer, unless the programmer is a wizard.  After the new object is created, its `initialize' verb, if any, is called with no arguments.
2

2
The new object is assigned the least non-negative object number that has not yet been used for a created object.  Note that no object number is ever reused, even if the object with that number is recycled.
2

2
The owner of the new object is either the programmer (if <owner> is not provided), the new object itself (if <owner> was given as `#-1'), or <owner> (otherwise).
2

2
The other built-in properties of the new object are initialized as follows:
2
    name         ""
2
    location     #-1
2
    contents     {}
2
    programmer   0
2
    wizard       0
2
    r            0
2
    w            0
2
    f            0
2

2
In addition, the new object inherits all of the other properties on <parent>.  These properties have the same permission bits as on <parent>.  If the `c' permissions bit is set, then the owner of the property on the new object is the same as the owner of the new object itself; otherwise, the owner of the property on the new object is the same as that on <parent>.  The initial value of every inherited property is "clear"; see the description of the built-in function `clear_property()' for details.
2

2

2
If the intended owner of the new object has a property named `ownership_quota' and the value of that property is a number, then `create()' treats that value as a "quota".  If the quota is less than or equal to zero, then the quota is considered to be exhausted and `create()' raises `E_QUOTA' instead of creating an object. Otherwise, the quota is decremented and stored back into the `ownership_quota' property as a part of the creation of the new object.

      setremove (LIST <list>, <value>)   => LIST

Returns a copy of <list> with the given <value> added or removed, as appropriate.  `Setadd()' only adds <value> if it is not already an element of <list>; <list> is thus treated as a mathematical set. <value> is added at the end of the resulting list, if at all.  Similarly, `setremove()' returns a list identical to <list> if <value> is not an element.  If <value> appears more than once in <list>, only the first occurrence is removed in the returned copy.

2
These functions return a copy of <list> with <value> added as a new element.  `listinsert()' and `listappend()' add <value> before and after (respectively) the existing element with the given <index>, if provided.
2

2
The following three expressions always have the same value:

    listinsert(<list>, <element>, <index>)

    listappend(<list>, <element>, <index> - 1)
2
    {@<list>[1..<index> - 1], <element>, @<list>[<index>..length(<list>)]}
2

2
If <index> is not provided, then `listappend()' adds the <value> at the end of the list and `listinsert()' adds it at the beginning; this usage is discouraged, however, since the same intent can be more clearly expressed using the list-construction expression, as shown in the examples below.

Syntax:  crypt (str <text> [, str <salt>])   => str
2

2
Encrypts the given <text> using the standard UNIX encryption method.  If provided, <salt> should be a two-character string for use as the extra encryption ``salt'' in the algorithm.  If <salt> is not provided, a random pair of characters is used.  In any case, the salt used is also returned as the first two characters of the resulting encrypted string.  
2

2
Aside from the possibly-random selection of the salt, the encryption algorithm is entirely deterministic.  In particular, you can test whether or not a given string is the same as the one used to produced a given piece of encrypted text; simply extract the first two characters of the encrypted text and pass the candidate string and those two characters to `crypt()'.  If the result is identical to the given encrypted text, then you've got a match.  
2

2
    crypt("foobar")         =>   "J3fSFQfgkp26w"
2
    crypt("foobar", "J3")   =>   "J3fSFQfgkp26w"

2
    crypt("foobar", "J4")   =>   "J4AcPxOJ4ncq2"
2

2
Note: As of version 1.8.3, the entire salt (of any length) is passed to the operating system's low-level crypt function.  It is unlikely, however, that all operating systems will return the same string when presented with a longer salt.  Therefore, identical calls to `crypt()' may generate different results on different platforms, and your password verification systems will fail.  Use a salt longer than two characters at your own risk.

By default, occurrences of <what> are searched for while ignoring the upper/lower case distinction. If <case-matters> is provided and true, then case is treated as significant in all comparisons.

<Mod> must be a positive integer; otherwise, E_INVARG is raised.  An integer is chosen randomly from the range `[1..<mod>]' and returned. If <mod> is not provided, it defaults to the largest MOO integer, 2147483647.

Syntax:  abs (num <x>)   => num

Syntax:  toobj (<value>)   => OBJ
2

2
Converts the given MOO value into an object number and returns that object number.  The conversions are very similar to those for `toint()' except that for strings, the number *may* be preceded by `#'.
2

2
    toobj("34")       =>   #34
2
    toobj("#34")      =>   #34

Syntax:  toint (<value>)   => INT
2
         tonum (<value>)   => INT
2

2
Converts the given MOO value into an integer and returns that integer. Floating-point numbers are rounded toward zero, truncating their fractional parts. Object numbers are converted into the equivalent integers, strings are parsed as the decimal encoding of a real number which is then converted to an integer. Errors are converted into integers obeying the same ordering (with respect to `<=' as the errors themselves.) `Toint()' raises E_TYPE if <value> is a LIST.  If <value> is a string but the string does not contain a syntactically-correct number, then `toint()' returns 0.

Syntax:  tostr (<value>, ...)   => STR
2

2
Converts all of the given MOO values into strings and returns the concatenation of the results.
2

2
    tostr(17)                  =>   "17"
2
    tostr(1.0/3.0)             =>   "0.333333333333333"
2
    tostr(#17)                 =>   "#17"
2
    tostr("foo")               =>   "foo"
2
    tostr({1, 2})              =>   "{list}"
2
    tostr(E_PERM)              =>   "Permission denied"
2
    tostr("3 + 4 = ", 3 + 4)   =>   "3 + 4 = 7"
2

2
Note that `tostr()' does not do a good job of converting lists into strings; all lists, including the empty list, are converted into the string `"{list}"'. The function `toliteral()' is better for this purpose.

Syntax:  typeof (<value>)   => INT
2

2
Takes any MOO value and returns a number representing the type of <value>. The result is the same as the initial value of one of these built-in variables: `INT', `FLOAT', `STR', `LIST', `OBJ', or `ERR'.  Thus, one usually writes code like this:
2

2
    if (typeof(x) == LIST) ...
2

2
and not like this:
2

2
    if (typeof(x) == 4) ...
2

2
because the former is much more readable than the latter.

Syntax:  clear_property (OBJ <object>, STR <prop-name>)  => none
2
      is_clear_property (OBJ <object>, STR <prop-name>)  => INT
2

2
These two functions test for clear and set to clear, respectively, the property named <prop-name> on the given <object>.  If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised.  If <object> has no non-built-in property named <prop-name>, then E_PROPNF is raised.  If the programmer does not have read (write) permission on the property in question, then `is_clear_property()' (`clear_property()') raises E_PERM. If a property is clear, then when the value of that property is queried the value of the parent's property of the same name is returned.  If the parent's property is clear, then the parent's parent's value is examined, and so on. If <object> is the definer of the property <prop-name>, as opposed to an inheritor of the property, then `clear_property()' raises E_INVARG.

Syntax:  set_connection_option (OBJ conn, STR option, value)   => none
2

2
Controls a number of optional behaviors associated the connection <conn>. Raises `E_INVARG' if <conn> does not specify a current connection and `E_PERM' if the programmer is neither <conn> nor a wizard. Unless otherwise specified below, options can only be set (<value> is true) or unset (otherwise). The following values for <option> are currently supported:  
2

2
"binary"
2
   When set, the connection is in `binary mode', in which case both input from and output to <conn> can contain arbitrary bytes. Input from a connection in binary mode is not broken into lines at all; it is delivered to either the read() function or normal command parsing as `binary strings', in whatever size chunks come back from the operating system. (See the early section in the LambdaMOO Programmers Manual on MOO value types for a description of the binary string representation.) For output to a connection in binary mode, the second argument to `notify()' must be a binary string; if it is malformed, `E_INVARG' is raised.
2

2
   Fine point: If the connection mode is changed at any time when there is pending input on the connection, said input will be delivered as per the previous mode (i.e., when switching out of binary mode, there may be pending ``lines'' containing tilde-escapes for embedded linebreaks, tabs, tildes and other characters; when switching into binary mode, there may be pending lines containing raw tabs and from which nonprintable characters have been silently dropped as per normal mode. Only during the initial invocation of `$do_login_command()' on an incoming connection or immediately after the call to `open_network_connection()' that creates an outgoing connection is there guaranteed not to be pending input. At other times you will probably want to flush any pending input immediately after changing the connection mode.
2

2
"hold-input"
2
   When set, no input received on <conn> will be treated as a command; instead, all input remains in the queue until retrieved by calls to `read()' or until this connection option is unset, at which point command processing resumes. Processing of out-of-band input lines is unaffected by this option.
2

2
"disable-oob"
2
   When set, disables all out of band processing. All subsequent input lines until the next command that unsets this option will be made available for reading tasks or normal command parsing exactly as if the out-of-band prefix and the out-of-band quoting prefix had not been defined for this server.
2

2
"client-echo"
2
   The setting of this option is of no significance to the server. However calling `set_connection_option()' for this option sends the Telnet Protocol `WONT ECHO' or `WILL ECHO' command, depending on whether <value> is true or false, respectively. For clients that support the Telnet Protocol, this should toggle whether or not the client echoes locally the characters typed by the user. Note that the server itself never echoes input characters under any circumstances. (This option is only available under the TCP/IP networking configurations.)
2

2
"flush-command"
2
   This option is string-valued. If <value> is a non-empty string, then it becomes the new `flush' command for this connection, by which the player can flush all queued input that has not yet been processed by the server. If the string is empty, then <conn> is set to have no flush command at all. `set_connection_option' also allows specifying a non-string <value> which is equivalent to specifying the empty string. The default value of this option can be set via the property `$server_options.default_flush_command'; see the chapter in the LambdaMOO Programmers Manual on server assumptions about the database for details.
2

2
"intrinsic-commands"
2
   This option value is a list of strings, each being the name of one of the available server intrinsic commands (see the section in the LambdaMOO Programmers Manual on Command Lines That Receive Special Treatment). Commands not on the list are disabled, i.e., treated as normal MOO commands to be handled by `$do_command' and/or the built-in command parser. `set_connection_option' also allows specifying an integer <value> which, if zero, is equivalent to specifying the empty list, and otherwise is taken to be the list of all available intrinsic commands (the default setting).  
2

2
   Thus, one way to make the verbname `PREFIX' available as an ordinary command is as follows:
2

2
    set_connection_option(player, "intrinsic-commands",
2
      setremove(connection_option(player, "intrinsic-commands"), "PREFIX"));
2

2
   Note that `connection_option()' always returns the list, even if `set_connection_option' was previously called with a numeric value.  Thus,
2

2
    save = connection_option(player,"intrinsic-commands");
2
    set_connection_option(player, "intrinsic-commands, 1);
2
    full_list = connection_option(player,"intrinsic-commands");
2
    set_connection_option(player,"intrinsic-commands", save);
2
    return full_list;
2

2
   is a way of getting the full list of intrinsic commands available in the server while leaving the current connection unaffected.

queue_info([obj user])

2
Returns the number of forked tasks that <user> has at the moment.  Since it doesn't say which tasks, security is not a significant issue.  If no argument is given, then gives a list of all users with task queues in the server.  (Essentially all connected players + all open connections + all users with tasks running in the background.)

Syntax:  is_member (ANY value, LIST list)   => INT
2

2
Returns true if there is an element of <list> that is completely indistinguishable from <value>. This is much the same operation as "<value> in <list>" except that, unlike `in', the `is_member()' function does not treat upper- and lower-case characters in strings as equal.
2

2
Raises E_ARGS if two values are given or if more than two values are given. Raises E_TYPE if the second argument is not a list. Otherwise returns the index of <value> in <list>, or 0 if it's not in there.

Syntax:  binary_hash (STR bin-string)   => STR
2
         string_hash (STR text)         => STR
2

2
Returns a 32-character hexadecimal string encoding the result of applying the MD5 cryptographically secure hash function to the contents of the string `text' or the binary string `bin-string'. MD5, like other such functions, has the property that, if
2

2
string_hash(x) == string_hash(y)
2

2
then, almost certainly
2

2
equal(x, y)
2

2
This can be useful, for example, in certain networking applications:  after sending a large piece of text across a connection, also send across the result of applying string_hash() to the text; if the destination site also applies string_hash() to the text and gets the same result, you can be quite confident that the large text has arrived unchanged.

2
Calls the built-in function named `func-name', passing the given arguments, and returns whatever that function returns. Raises E_INVARG if func-name is not recognized as the name of a known built-in function. This allows you to compute the name of the function to call and, in particular, allows you to write a call to a built-in function that may or may not exist in the particular version of the server you're using.

Syntax:  decode_binary (STR bin-string [, fully])   => LIST

2
Returns a list of strings and/or integers representing the bytes in the binary string <bin-string> in order. If <fully> is false or omitted, the list contains an integer only for each non-printing, non-space byte; all other characters are grouped into the longest possible contiguous substrings. If <fully> is proved and true, the list contains only integers, one for each byte represented in <bin-string>. Raises E_INVARG if <bin-string> is not a properly-formed binary string. (See the LambdaMOO programmer's manual on MOO value types for a full description of binary strings.)

Returns a (longish) list of strings giving a listing of the server's internal "compiled" form of the verb as specified by <verb-desc> on <object>. This format may indeed change from release to release, but some programmers may nonetheless find the output of `disassemble()' interesting to peruse as a way to gain a deeper appreciation of how the server works.
2

2
If <object> is not valid, then E_INVARG is raised. If <object> does not define a verb as specified by <verb-desc>, then E_VERBNF is raised. If the programmer does not have read permission on the verb in question, then disassemble() raises E_PERM.

Each line of output roughly follows the form: <frame number>: <opcode byte> <opcode arguments (if any)> <ticks?> <human readable opcode mnemonic and arguments>

Syntax:  encode_binary(arg, ...)   => STR

Each argument must be an integer between 0 and 255, a string, or a list containing only legal arguments for this function. This function translates each integer and string in turn into its binary string equivalent, returning the concatenation of all these substrings into a single binary string. (See the early sections in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual on MOO value types for a full description of binary strings.)

Syntax:  floatstr (FLOAT x, INT precision [, scientific])   => STR
2

2
Converts <x> into a string with more control than provided by either `tostr()' or `toliteral()'. <Precision> is the number of digits to appear to the right of the decimal point, capped at 4 more than the maximum available precision, a total of 19 on most machines; this makes it possible to avoid rounding errors if the resulting string is subsequently read back as a floating-point value. If <scientific> is false or not provided, the result is a string in the form "MMMMMMM.DDDDDD", preceded by a minus sign if and only if <x> is negative. If <scientific> is provided and true, the result is a string in the form "M.DDDDDDe+EEE", again preceded by a minus sign if and only if <x> is negative.

Inserts the string <line> as an input task in the queue for the connection <conn>, just as if it had arrived as input over the network. If <at-front> is provided and true, then the new line of input is put at the front of <conn>'s queue, so that it will be the very next line of input processed even if there is already some other input in that queue. Raises E_INVARG if <conn> does not specify a current connection and E_PERM if the programmer is neither <conn> nor a wizard.

Syntax:  function_info ([STR name])   => LIST
2

2
Returns descriptions of the various built-in functions available on the server. If <name> is provided, only the description of the function with that name is returned. If <name> is omitted, a list of descriptions is returned, one for each function available on the server. E_INVARG is raised if <name> is provided but no function with that name is available on the server.
2

2
Each function description is a list of the following form:
2

2
  {<name>, <min-args>, <max-args>, <types>}
2

2
where <name> is the name of the built-in function, <min-args> is the minimum number of arguments that must be to the function, <max-args> is the maximum number of arguments that can be provided to the function or -1 if there is no maximum, and <types> is a list of <max-args> integers (or <min-args> if <max-args> is -1), each of which represents the type of argument required in the corresponding position. Each type number is as would be returned from the `typeof()' built-in function except that -1 indicates that any type of value is acceptable and -2 indicates that either integers or floating-point numbers may be given. For example, here are several entries from the list:
2

2
  {"listdelete", 2, 2, {4, 0}}
2
  {"suspend", 0, 1, {0}}
2
  {"server_log", 1, 2, {2, -1}}
2
  {"max", 1, -1, {-2}}
2
  {"tostr", 0, -1, {}}
2

`Listdelete()' takes exactly 2 arguments, of which the first must be a list (LIST == 4) and the second must be an integer (INT == 0). `Suspend()' has one optional argument that, if provided, must be an integer. `Server_log()' has one required argument that must be a string (STR == 2) and one optional argument that, if provided, may be of any type. `Max()' requires at least one argument but can take any number above that, and the first argument must be either an integer or a floating-point number; the type(s) required for any other arguments can't be determined from this description. Finally, `tostr()' takes any number of arguments at all, but it can't be determined from this description which argument types would be acceptable in which positions.

Syntax:  listen (OBJ object, point [, print-messages, use_ipv6])   => value
2

2
Create a new point at which the server will listen for network connections, just as it does normally. <Object> is the object whose verbs `do_login_command', `do_command', `do_out_of_band_command', `user_connected', `user_created', `user_reconnected', `user_disconnected', and `user_client_disconnected' will be called at appropriate points asthese verbs are called on #0 for normal connections. (See the chapter in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual on server assumptions about the database for the complete story on when these functions are called.) <Point> is a network-configuration-specific parameter describing the listening point. If <print-messages> is provided and true, then the various database-configurable messages (also detailed in the chapter on server assumptions) will be printed on connections received at the new listening point. `Listen()' returns <canon>, a `canonicalized' version of <point>, with any configuration-specific defaulting or aliasing accounted for.
2

2
This raises E_PERM if the programmer is not a wizard, E_INVARG if <object> is invalid or there is already a listening point described by <point>, and E_QUOTA if some network-configuration-specific error occurred.
2

2
For the TCP/IP configurations, <point> is a TCP port number on which to listen and <canon> is equal to <point> unless <point> is zero, in which case <canaon> is a port number assigned by the operating system.
2

2
For the local multi-user configurations, <point> is the UNIX file name to be used as the connection point and <canon> is always equal to <point>.
2

2
In the single-user configuration, there can be only one listening point at a time; <point> can be any value at all and <canon> is always zero.
2

2
If <use_ipv6> is true, the connection will listen on the IPv6 interface.

2
Syntax:  listeners ([<obj>])  => LIST
2

2
Returns a list of maps describing all existing listening points, including the default one set up automatically by the server when it was started (unless that one has since been destroyed by a call to `unlisten()'). Each element of the list has the following keys:
2

2
[<object>, <port>, <print-messages>, <ipv6>]
2

2
where <object> is the first argument given in the call to `listen()' to create this listening point, <print-messages> is true if the third argument in that call was provided and true, <ipv6> is true if the connection is listening on the IPv6 interface, and <port> was the value returned by that call. (For the initial listening point, <object> is #0, <port> is determined by the command-line arguments or a network-configuration-specific default, and <print-messages> is true.)
2

2
An optional argument, <obj>, can be supplied to filter the list of listeners by that object only.

Syntax:  log (FLOAT x)     => FLOAT
2
         log10 (FLOAT x)   => FLOAT

2
Returns the natural or base 10 logarithm of <x>. Raises E_INVARG if <x> is not positive.

Syntax:  object_bytes (OBJ object)   => INT
2

2
Returns the number of bytes of the server's memory required to store the given <object>, including the space used by the values of all its non-clear properties and by the verbs and properties defined directly on the object. Raises E_INVARG if <object> is not a valid object and E_PERM if the programmer is not a wizard.

2
Syntax:  raise (code [, STR message [, value]])   => none
2

2
Raises <code> as an error in the same way as other MOO expressions, statements, and functions do. <Message>, which defaults to the value `tostr(<code>)', and <value>, which defaults to zero, are made available to any `try-except' statements to catch the error. If the error is not caught, then <message> will appear on the first line of the traceback printed to the user.

2
Syntax:  resume (INT task-id [, value])   => none
2

2
Immediately ends the suspension of the suspended task with the given <task-id>; that task's call to `suspend()' will return <value>, which defaults to zero. `Resume()' raises E_INVARG if <task-id> does not specify an existing suspended task and E_PERM if the programmer is neither a wizard nor the owner of the specified task.
36
5

3
2
Syntax:  task_stack (INT task-id [, include-line-numbers])  => LIST
2

2
Returns information like that returned by the `callers()' function, but for the suspended task with the given <task-id>; the <include-line-numbers> argument has the same meaning as in `callers()'. Raises E_INVARG if <task-id> does not specify an existing suspended task and E_PERM if the programmer is neither a wizard nor the owner of the specified task.
36
5

9
2
Syntax:  tofloat (value)   => FLOAT
2

2
Converts the given MOO value into a floating-point number and returns that number. Integers and objects numbers are converted into the corresponding integral floating-point numbers. Strings are parsed as the decimal encoding of a real number which is then represented as closely as possible as a floating-point number. Errors are first converted to integers as in `toint()' and then converted as integers are. `Tofloat()' raises E_TYPE if <value> is a LIST. If <value> is a string but the string does not contain a syntactically-correct number, then `tofloat()' raises E_INVARG.
2

2
  tofloat(34)       =>  34.0
2
  tofloat(#34)      =>  34.0
2
  tofloat("34")     =>  34.0
2
  tofloat("34.7")   =>  34.7
2
  tofloat(E_TYPE)   =>  1.0

Syntax:  trunc (FLOAT <x>)   => FLOAT
2

2
Returns the integer obtained by truncating <x> at the decimal point, as a floating-point number. For negative <x>, this is equivalent to `ceil()'; otherwise, it is equivalent to `floor()'.
36
5
4
3
2
Syntax:  unlisten (<canon>)   => none
2

2
Stop listening for connections on the point described by <canon>, which should be the second element of some element of the list returned by `listeners()'. Raises E_PERM if the programmer is not a wizard and E_INVARG if there does not exist a listener with that description.
36

2
Syntax:  value_hash (<value>)   => STR
2

2
Returns the same string as `string_hash(toliteral(<value>))'; see the description of `string_hash()' for details.

2
Syntax:  load_server_options ()   => none
2

2
After modifying properties on $server_options, wizards must call `load_server_options()'.  Changes made may not take effect until this function is called.  This allows the server to cache option values internally; this significantly speeds up built-in function invocation.  If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.

2
Syntax:  verb_cache_stats ()   => LIST
2
         log_cache_stats ()    => none
2

2
As of version 1.8.1, the server caches verbname-to-program lookups to improve performance.  These functions respectively return or write to the server log file the current cache statistics.  For `verb_cache_stats' the return value will be a list of the form
2

2
    {<hits>, <negative_hits>, <misses>, <table_clears>, <histogram>}
2

2
though this may change in future server releases.  The cache is invalidated by any builtin function call that may have an effect on verb lookups (e.g., `delete_verb()').

2
A help database (in the sense of anything that is usable by $player:help()) is any object having the following two verbs:
2

2
  :find_topics(string)
2
     returns a list of strings or some boolean false value.
2

2
  :get_topic(string)
2
     given one of the strings returned by :find_topics this either
2
     returns a list of strings (text to be spewed to the player) or
2
     returns 1 to indicate that it has already taken care of printing
2
     information to the player.
2

2
$player:help() consults any .help properties that exist on the player, its ancestors, player.location and its ancestors (in that order).  These properties are assumed to have values that are objects or lists of objects, each object itself assumed to be a help database in the above sense.  The main help database ($help) is placed at the end of the list of databases to be consulted.
2

2
The Generic Help Database (this object) is the standard model help database of which the actual help database itself ($help) is an instance.  On help databases of this type, every help topic has a corresponding property, interpreted as follows:
2

2
this.(topic) = string           - one-line help text.
2
this.(topic) = {"*verb*",@args} - call this:verb(@args) to get text
2
this.(topic) = any other list   - multi-line help text
2

2
For the {"*verb*",...} form, the current verbs available are
2

2
  {"*forward*", topic2, @rest}   
2
     - get topic2 help text and then append rest.  
2
       rest may, in turn, begin with a "*verb*"...
2

2
  {"*subst*", @lines} 
2
     - all occurences of %[exp] in lines are replaced with value of exp.  
2
       exp is assumed to evaluate to a string.  Evaluation is done using 
2
       $no_one's permissions so exp can only refer to public information.
2

2
  {"*index*"}
2
     - returns a list of all topics in this database, arranged in columns.

2
  :remove   (seq,f,t)  => seq with [f..t] interval removed
2
  :range    (f,t)      => sequence corresponding to [f..t]
2
  {}                   => empty sequence
2
  :contains (seq,n)    => n in seq
2
  :size     (seq)      => number of elements in seq
2
  :first    (seq)      => first integer in seq or E_NONE
2
  :firstn   (seq,n)    => first n integers in seq (as a sequence)
2
  :last     (seq)      => last integer in seq  or E_NONE
2
  :lastn    (seq,n)    => last n integers in seq (as a sequence)
2

2
  :complement   (seq)         => sequence consisting of integers not in seq
2
  :union        (seq,seq,...) => union of all sequences
2
  :intersection (seq,seq,...) => intersection of all sequences
2
  :contract (seq,cseq)              (see `help $seq_utils:contract')
2
  :expand   (seq,eseq[,include])    (see `help $seq_utils:expand')
2
  
2
  :extract(seq,array)           => array[@seq]
2
  :for([n,]seq,obj,verb,@args)  => for s in (seq) obj:verb(s,@args); endfor
2

2
  :tolist(seq)            => list corresponding to seq
2
  :tostr(seq)             => contents of seq as a string
2
  :from_list(list)        => sequence corresponding to list
2
  :from_sorted_list(list) => sequence corresponding to list (assumed sorted)
2
  :from_string(string)    => sequence corresponding to string
2

2
For boolean expressions, note that
2
  the representation of the empty sequence is {} (boolean FALSE) and
2
  all non-empty sequences are represented as nonempty lists (boolean TRUE).
2

2
The representation used works better than the usual list implementation for sets consisting of long uninterrupted ranges of integers.  
2
For sparse sets of integers the representation is decidedly non-optimal (though it never takes more than double the space of the usual list representation).
2

2
(*) i.e., integers in the range [$minint+1..$maxint].  The implementation depends on $minint never being included in a sequence.

This object is useful for announcing messages that switch between third and second person when addressed to the appropriate parties in a room.
2

2
Verbs:
2

2
  :verb_sub(STR verbspec) -> conjugates the given verb into singular form
2
  :say_action(message [,who [,thing, [,where]]]) -> appropriately pronoun 
2
      substituted message announced to where, which defaults to who.location
2
      where who defaults to player.
2
  Ex:  if player=#123 (Munchkin), dobj=#456 (Frebblebit), and iobj=#789
2
       (Bob) and they are all in the same room,
2
       $you:say_action("%N %<waves> happily to %d and %i.") would do this:
2

2
Munchkin sees:       You wave happily to Frebblebit and Bob.
2
Frebblebit sees:     Munchkin waves happily to you and Bob.
2
Bob sees:            Munchkin waves happily to Frebblebit and you.
2
Everyone else sees:  Munchkin waves happily to Frebblebit and Bob.

Defines the list of standard genders, the default pronouns for each, and routines for adding or setting pronoun properties on any gendered object.
2

2
Properties:
2
  .genders  -- list of standard genders
2
  .pronouns -- list of pronoun properties
2
  .ps .po .pp .pq .pr .psc .poc .ppc .pqc .prc 
2
            -- lists of pronouns for each of the standard genders
2

2
  If foo is of gender this.gender[n], 
2
  then the default pronoun foo.p is this.p[n] 
2
  (where p is one of ps/po/pp/pq...)
2

2
Verbs:
2
  :set(object,newgender) -- changes pronoun properties to match new gender.
2
  :add(object[,perms[,owner]]) -- adds pronoun properties to object.
2

2
  :get_pronoun     (which,object) -- return pronoun for a given object
2
  :get_conj*ugation(verbspec,object) -- return appropriately conjugated verb

Miscellaneous routines for permissions checking
2

2
For a complete description of a given verb, do `help $perm_utils:verbname'
2

2
:controls(who,what) -- can who write on object what
2
:controls_property(who,what,propname) -- can who write on what.propname
2
These routines check write flags and also the wizardliness of `who'.
2

2
(these last two probably belong on $code_utils)
2

2
:apply(permstring,mods)
2
  -- used by @chmod to apply changes (e.g., +x) 
2
     to a given permissions string
2

2
:caller()
2
  -- returns the first caller in the callers() stack distinct from `this'

Syntax: emote <text>
2
        :<text>
2

2
(EDITOR)
2
Appends <text> to the end of the line before the insertion point.
2
The second form is equivalent to the first except that it doesn't strip leading blanks off of <text> (just as with the normal `emote' and `:' commands).
2
The insertion point is left unmoved.
2

2
    >list .
2
    _37_ Hello there
2
    ^38^ Oh, I'm fine.
2
    >:, how are you
2
    Appended to line 37.
2
    >:?
2
    Appended to line 37.
2
    >list .
2
    _37_ Hello there, how are you?

2
Syntax: say <text>
2
        "<text>
2

2
(EDITOR)
2
Adds <text> to whatever you are editing.
2
The second form is equivalent to the first except in that it doesn't strip leading blanks off of <text> (just as with the normal `say' and `"' commands).
2

2
The added text appears as a new line at the insertion point.  The insertion point, in turn, gets moved so as to be after the added text.  For example:
2

2
    >"first line
2
    Line 1 added.
2
    >"  second line"
2
    Line 2 added.
2
    >list
2
      1: first line
2
    __2_   second line"
2
    ^^^^

Syntax:  del*ete [<range>] 
2

2
(EDITOR)
2
Deletes the specified range of lines
2
<range> defaults to the line *before* the current insertion point.

2
Syntax:  ins*ert [<ins>] ["<text>]
2
         .                    (`.' == `insert' without arguments)
2

2
(EDITOR)
2
Many editor commands refer to an "insertion point" which is (usually) the place right below where the most recent line was inserted.  The insertion point should really be thought of as sitting *between* lines.  In listings, the line above the insertion point is marked with `_' while the one below is marked with `^'.
2

2
The `insert' command, when given an argument, sets the insertion point.
2
If <text> is provided, a new line will be created and inserted as with `say'.
2
<ins>, both here and in other commands that require specifying an insertion point (e.g., copy/move), can be one of
2
          
2
    ^n   above line n
2
     n   above line n
2
    _n   below line n
2
     $   at the end
2
    ^$   before the last line
2
   n^$   n lines before the end
2
     .   the current insertion point  (i.e., `insert .' is a no-op)

    +n   n lines below the current insertion point.
2
    -n   n lines above the current insertion point.

2
For the truly perverse, there are other combinations that also work due to artifacts of the parsing process, but these might go away...

Syntax:  view <player> [<range>] [nonum]
2
         view
2

2
Prints some subset of the specified player's text.
2
Said player must have previously made his text readable with `publish'.
2
<ranges> are specified as in other commands (see `help ranges').
2
References to the insertion point refer to wherever the other player has set his/her insertion point; you have no control over it.
2
The default range is as in list.
2

2
If no arguments are given, this lists all of the players that have published anything in this editor.

2
Syntax:  pub*lish
2

2
By default, only you (and wizards) can read the text you are editing.
2
This command makes your text readable by the entire world (see `help view').
2
This is useful if you need help from someone or if you just want to show off your programming acumen.
2
Use `unpublish' to make your text private again.

(NOTE EDITOR)
2
Syntax:  mode
2
         mode string
2
         mode list
2
         
2
There are (currently) two modes the note editor can be in.
2
One is string mode, in which if the text being edited is one line or less, 
2
it will be saved as a single string (or an empty string) rather than as a list.
2
The other is list mode, in which text is always saved as a list of strings.
2
The mode is set when the text is first loaded (string mode if the text is a string, list mode otherwise), but can be changed using this command.
2

2
The first form above (i.e., without any arguments) reports the current mode.
36

2
Syntax:  enter
2

2
(EDITOR)
2
Enters a sequence of lines at the insertion point (see `help insert').
2
This is similar to .program in that every line you type after the `enter' command is inserted verbatim into the text until you type a line with a single period (`.') on it.  This command is essentially for if you don't like the idea of putting " at the beginning of each line you type.  The only exceptions, i.e., lines that are not entered verbatim (aside from the `.' line), are
2

2
 - If you type a line whose sole text is `@abort', 
2
   that aborts this command without making any changes to the text.  
2
 - Any line whose first nonblank character is `.' and has additional text
2
   is entered but with its first `.' stripped off.  
2

2
Thus, to enter a line whose text is `@abort', you could enter it as `.@abort'.

2
Syntax:  q*uit
2
         done
2

(EDITOR)
2
Leaves the editor.  If you have unsaved text it will be there when you return (and in fact you will not be able to do anything else with this editor until you 'abort' or save the text).
2

2
Syntax: unsubscribe from <list-name>
2
        unsubscribe <name>... from <list-name>
2

2
(MAILROOM)
2
Remove yourself from the given mailing list.
2
The second form removes arbitrary people from a mailing list.
2
You can only do this if you own whatever is being removed or you own the list.
2

2
Use the `who' command to determine if you are on a given mailing list.
36

2
Syntax: subscribe to <list-name>
2
        subscribe [<name>...] to <list-name>
2

2
(MAILROOM)
2
Add yourself to the given mailing list.  
2
The second form adds arbitrary people to a mailing list.
2
You can only do this if you own the list or if it is listed as [Public] and you own whatever is being added.
2

2
The first form of this command is probably obsolete since if <list-name> is public, you can already read it via `@mail on *<list-name>' and it's much better for the MOO if you do so.  `@mail-option +sticky' makes this even easier.
2

2
Use the `who' command to determine if you are on a given mailing list.

2
Syntax:  reply-to [<recipients>]
2

2
(MAIL ROOM)
2
Reports the current contents of the Reply-to: field of your message.
2
With arguments, adds (or changes) the Reply-to: field.
2

2
When someone @answers a message, the Reply-to: field is checked first when determining to whom the reply should be sent --- see `help @answer'.
2

2
To clear the Reply-to: field, do
2

2
         reply-to ""

2
Syntax:  f*ind  /<str>[/[c][<ins>]]
2
         /<str>[/[c][<ins>]]
2

2
Searches for the first line after <ins> containing <str>.  <ins> defaults to  the current insertion point (see `help insert' for how to specify other places).  With the first form, any character (not just `/') may be used as a delimiter.
2
For the second form, you must use '/'.
2

2
The 'c' flag, if given, indicates that case is to be ignored while searching.
2

2
[Bug: With the second form, there are problems if the search string contains quotes, backslashes or a run of spaces.  The first whitespace will always be treated as a single space.  Likewise, quotes and backslashes occuring in the first word of the command (i.e., the "verb") need to be escaped with `\'.  Unfortunately it will not be possible to fix this until we get a new command parser.]

(VERB EDITOR)
2
Syntax:  edit <object>:<verb>
2

2
Changes what verb you are editing and loads the code for that verb
2
into the editor. 
2
Equivalent to @edit <object>:<verb>.
2

2
(NOTE EDITOR)
2
Syntax:  edit <note-object>
2
         edit <object>.<property>
2

2
Changes to a different note or a different object text property and 
2
loads its text into the editor.
2
These are equivalent to @notedit <note> or @notedit <object>.<property>
2
respectively.
2

2
For both the verb-editor and note-editor commands, <object> will match on the room you came from, though if the room you came from was another editor, then all bets are off...
36
5
4
5
2
Syntax:  compile [as <object>:<verb>]
2

2
(VERB EDITOR)
2
Installs the new program into the system if there are no syntax errors.
2
If a new object:verb is specified and actually turns out to exist, that <object>:<verb> becomes the default for subsequent compilations.
36
5
4
5
2
Syntax:  save [<note-object>]
2
         save [<object>.<property>]
2

2
(NOTE EDITOR)
2
Installs the freshly edited text.  If <note> or <object>.<property> is specified, text is installed on that note or property instead of the original one.  In addition the new note or property becomes the default for future save commands.
36
5

Print a list of the publically available mailing lists/archives and other non-player entities that can receive mail.
36
5
4
4
2
Syntax:  subj*ect [<text>]
2

2
(MAIL ROOM)

36
5
4
6
2
Syntax:  to [<recipients>]
2

2
(MAIL ROOM)
2
Specifies a new set of recipients (the To: line) for your message.
2
Recipient names not beginning with * are matched against the list of players.
2
Recipient names beginning with * are interpreted as mailing-lists/archives/other types of non-person addresses and are matched against all such publically available objects (see `help showlists').  If the list you want to use isn't in the database (i.e., isn't located in the database ($mail_agent)) you need to refer to it by object id.
36

2
Syntax:  also-to [<recipients>]

2
Same rules apply as for the `to' command.
36
5

2
Syntax:  who 
2
         who <rcpt>...
2

2
(MAIL ROOM)
2
Invokes $mail_agent's mail-forwarding tracer and determines who (or what) is actually going to receive your message.  The resulting list will not include destinations that will simply forward the message without :receive_message()'ing a copy for themselves.
2

2
The second form expands an arbitrary list of recipients, for if e.g., you're curious about the members of particular mailing list.
36

(MAIL ROOM)
2
Display your message including headers.
36
5
4
8
2
Syntax:  send
2

2
(MAIL ROOM)
2
Send the message, then exit the mail room if all of the addresses on the To: line turn out to be valid and usable (you can use the `who' command to check these in advance, though the status of recipients may change without warning).
2
If the To: line turns out to contain invalid recipients or recipients that are not usable by you, the message will not be sent and you will remain in the mail room.
2
It may be, however, that valid addresses on your To: line will forward to other addresses that are bogus; you'll receive warnings about these, but in this case your message will still be delivered to those addresses that are valid.
2

2
Note that there may be particularly long delays when sending to recipients with large forwarding/notification lists or when sending on occasions when the MOO is heavily loaded in general.  In such a case, it is possible to continue editing the message while the send is in progress; any such edits affect only the text in the editor.  In particular, the text of the message currently being sent remains as it was when you first typed the send command.  However, any editing will mark the text as "changed" meaning that you will need to explicitly `abort' or `quit' in order to leave the mail room even if the send concludes successfully.

2
Syntax:  lis*t [<range>] [nonum]
2

2
Prints some subset of the current verb text.
2
The default range is some reasonable collection of lines around the current insertion point:  currently this is 8_-8^, ie., 8 lines above the insertion point to 8 lines below it unless this runs up against the beginning or end of file, in which case we just take the first or last 16 lines, or just 1-$ if there aren't that many.  (See `help ranges' for how to specify line numbers and ranges.)
2

2
`nonum' prints without line numbers.
2

2
Yes, window heights will be customizable some day.
36

4
2
Syntax:  n*ext [n] ["<text>]
2

2
Moves the insertion point down n lines.  If <text> is provided, inserts a new line there just like `say'.
2
Equivalent to `insert +n'.  As one might expect, n defaults to 1.
36
5
4
4
2
Syntax:  p*rev [n] ["<text>]
2

2
Moves the insertion point up n lines.  If <text> is provided, a new line is inserted as with `say'.
2
Equivalent to `insert -n'.  As one might expect, n defaults to 1.
36
5
4
20
2
Syntax:  s*ubst/<str1>/<str2>[/[g][c][r][<range>]]
2

2
Substitutes <str2> for <str1>, in all of the lines of <range>.
2
Any character (not just `/') may be used to delimit the strings. 
2
If <str1> is blank, <str2> is inserted at the beginning of the line.  
2
(For inserting a string at the end of a line use emote/:).
2

2
Normally, only one substitution is done per line in the specified range, but if the 'g' flag is given, *all* instances of <str1> are replaced.
2
The 'c' flag indicates that case is not significant when searching for substitution instances.
2

2
The `r' flag means that the command will be grepped and matched using regular expressions. This is how you perform a regexp subst:
2

2
The <str1> field will be understood as a regular expression. If you are unfamiliar with regexp protocol, read `help regular-expressions'.
2
In cases where successful matches are made, the <str2> string will be run through the substitute() builtin, with the match() info as an argument, before replacing the old string.
2
So, in short. If `match(line, <str1>)' returns something, then `substitute(<str2>, match result)' is subbed in its place. The `g' and `c' arguments are still applicable.
2

2
<range> defaults to the line *before* the insertion point.
2

2
You do *not* need a space between the verb and the delimeter before <str1>.
2
[Bug: If you omit the space and the first whitespace in <str1> is a run of more than one space, those spaces get treated as one.  Likewise, quotes and backslashes occuring in the first word of the command (i.e., the "verb") need to be escaped with `\'.  The fix on this will have to wait for a new command parser.]

4
2
Syntax:  join        [<range>]
2
         joinliteral [<range>]
2

2
combines the lines in the specified range.  Normally, spaces are inserted and double space appears after periods and colons, but 'joinliteral' (abbreviates to 'joinl') supresses this and joins the lines as is.  <range> defaults to the two lines surrounding the insertion point.
36
5
4
3
2
Syntax:  fill [<range>] [@ c]
2

2
combines the specified lines as in join and then splits them so that no line is more than c characters (except in cases of pathological lines with very long words).  c defaults to 70.  <range> defaults to the single line preceding the insertion point.
36
5
4
6
2
Syntax:  m*ove [<range>] to <ins>
2

2
Moves the range of lines to place specified by <ins>.
2
If <ins> happens to be the current insertion point, the insertion point is moved to the end of the freshly moved lines.  If the range of lines contains the insertion point, the insertion point is carried over to the range's new location.
2

2
See `help insert' for a list of possibilities for <ins>.
36

2
Syntax:  c*opy [<range>] to <ins>
2

Copies the specified range of lines to place given by <ins>.
2

2
point moves to the end of the inserted lines.
2

2
See `help insert' for a list of possibilities for <ins>.

Most editor commands act upon a particular range of lines.
2
Essentially, one needs to specify a first line and a last line.
2
Line numbers may be given in any of the following forms
2
  
2
  n      (i.e., the nth line of text)
2
  n^     n-th line after/below  the current insertion point
2
  n_     n-th line before/above the current insertion point
2
  n$     n-th line before the end.
2

2
In the latter three, n defaults to 1, so that `^' by itself refers to the line below the current (i.e., the line that gets `^' printed before it), and likewise for `_' while `$' refers to the last line.  Note that the usage depends on whether you are specifying a line or an insertion point (space between lines). `^5' is the space above/before line 5, while `5^' is the fifth line after/below the current insertion point.
2

2
Ranges of lines may be specified in any of the
2
following ways:
2

2
  <line>                  just that line
2
  from <line> to <line>   what it says; the following two forms are equivalent:
2
  <line>-<line>            
2
  <line> <line>
2

2
With the `from l to l' form, either the from or the to can be left off and it will default to whatever is usual for that command (usually a line above or below the insertion point).  Actually I was thinking of punting the `from'/`to' specifications entirely because they're so verbose.  Opinions?

This is the database of mailing-list/mail-folder objects.
2
The basic procedure for creating a new list/folder is to create a child of $mail_recipient (Generic Mail Recipient) assign it a suitable name&aliases, set a suitable .mail_forward/.mail_notify (or create suitable :mail_forward() and :mail_notify() verbs) and then teleport it here.

These routines are useful for finding out information about individual objects.
2

2
Examining everything an object has defined on it:
2
  all_verbs          (object) => like it says
2
  all_properties     (object) => likewise
2
  findable_properties(object) => tests to see if caller can "find" them
2
  owned_properties   (object[, owner]) => tests for ownership
2

2
Investigating inheritance:
2
  ancestors(object[,object...]) => all ancestors
2
  descendants      (object)     => all descendants
2
  ordered_descendants(object)   => descendants, in a different order
2
  leaves           (object)     => descendants with no children
2
  branches         (object)     => descendants with children 
2
  isa        (object,class) => true iff object is a descendant of class (or ==)
2
  property_conflicts (object,newparent) => can object chparent to newparent?
2
  isoneof     (object,list)     => true if object :isa class in list of parents
2

2
Considering containment:
2
  contains      (obj1, obj2) => Does obj1 contain obj2 (nested)?
2
  all_contents      (object) => return all the (nested) contents of object
2
  locations         (object) => list of location hierarchy above object
2

2
Verifying verbs and properties:
2
  has_property(object,pname) => false/true   according as object.(pname) exists
2
  has_readable_property(object,pname) => false/true if prop exists and is +r
2
  defines_property(object,pname) => does object *define* this property
2
  has_verb    (object,vname) => false/{#obj} according as object:(vname) exists
2
  has_callable_verb          => same, but verb must be callable from a program
2
  defines_verb(object,vname) => does this object *define* this verb
2
  match_verb  (object,vname) => false/{location, newvname}
2
                               (identify location and usable name of verb)
2
  accessible_verbs(object)   => a list of verb names (or E_PERM) regardless of 
2
                                readability of object
2

2
Player checking:
2
  connected         (object) => true if object is a player and is connected
2

2
Suspending:
2
  Many of the above verbs have ..._suspended versions to assist with very large object hierarchies.  The following exist:
2
   descendants_suspended              
2
   branches_suspended                 
2
   leaves_suspended                   
2
   all_properties_suspended           
2
   descendants_with_property_suspended

These routines are used when locking objects, and when testing an object's lock before allowing use (such as in an exit).
2

2
:parse_keyexp   (string keyexpression, object player)
2
        => returns an object or list for the new key as defined by the
2
           keyexpression or a string describing the error if it failed.
2

2
:eval_key       (LIST|OBJ key, testobject)
2
        => returns true if the given testobject satisfies the key.
2

2
:unparse_key    (LIST|OBJ key)
2
        => returns a string describing the key in english/moo-code terms.
2

2

An association list (alist) is a list of pairs (2-element lists), though the following functions have been generalized for lists of n-tuples (n-element lists).  In each case i defaults to 1.
2

2

2
slice             (alist[,i]) => list of i-th elements

2

2
-- Functions that suspend --
2

2
Each of these either suspends(0) as needed or takes an interval in seconds for the suspend as a first argument. See help $list_utils:<verb>.

$command_utils is the repository for verbs that are of general usefulness to authors of all sorts of commands.  For more details about any of these verbs, use `help $command_utils:<verb-name>'.

2
Detecting and Handling Failures in Matching
2
-------------------------------------------
2
:object_match_failed(match_result, name)
2
    Test whether or not a :match_object() call failed and print messages if so.
2
:player_match_failed(match_result, name)
2
    Test whether or not a :match_player() call failed and print messages if so.
2
:player_match_result(match_results, names)
2
    ...similar to :player_match_failed, but does a whole list at once.
2

2
Reading Input from the Player
2
-----------------------------
2
:read()         -- Read one line of input from the player and return it.
2
:yes_or_no([prompt])
2
                -- Prompt for and read a `yes' or `no' answer.
2
:read_lines()   -- Read zero or more lines of input from the player.
2
:dump_lines(lines) 
2
                -- Return list of lines quoted so that feeding them to 
2
                   :read_lines() will reproduce the original lines.
2
:read_lines_escape(escapes[,help])
2
                -- Like read_lines, except you can provide more escapes
2
                   to terminate the read.
2

2
Feature Objects
2
---------------
2
:validate_feature -- compare command line against feature verb argument spec
2

2
Utilities for Suspending
2
------------------------
2
:running_out_of_time()
2
                -- Return true if we're low on ticks or seconds.
2
:suspend_if_needed(time)
2
                -- Suspend (and return true) if we're running out of time.
2

2
Client Support for Lengthy Commands
2
-----------------------------------
2
:suspend(args)  -- Handle PREFIX and SUFFIX for clients in long commands.

Syntax:  @pagelength <number>
2
         @pagelength
2

2
If the lines you see scroll off the top of your screen too quickly for you to
2
read and your client program is such that any lines scrolling off the top are
2
gone forever, you can use the @pagelength command to invoke page buffering to
2
limit the number of lines sent at a time.  E.g., if your terminal has a 24 line
2
screen, you can do @pagelength 24 and output will stop every 24 lines if you
2
don't type any other commands.
2

2
You will need to use the @more command to continue reading output once it 
2
has been stopped.  Make sure you read `help @more' before setting @pagelength.
2

2
@pagelength 0 means no page buffering will be done by the MOO.
2

2
By default the MOO will assume you have an infinitely wide terminal screen, so
2
you may wish to set @linelength as well, and ensure wrapping is on with @wrap
2
on.  (See help @linelength and help @wrap.)  As with word wrapping, you are
2
best off running a client that can do its own page buffering; the MOO server's
2
page buffering is inherently slower and many MUD's do not have page buffering
2
at all.

Syntax:  @more

         @more rest
2
         @more flush
2

2
If you have @pagelength set (see `help @pagelength') and some combination of events or commands produces sufficiently many lines of output, you will see a message of the form
2

2
%[strsub(player.more_msg,"%%n","37")]
2

2
indicating (in this case) 37 more lines of text waiting to be read.  
2
At this point, you should give one of the @more commands above.  
2

2
@more without arguments prints sufficiently many lines to fill your screen,
2
assuming you've set @pagelength correctly, unless there are not that many
2
lines left to print.
2

2
@more rest will print all of the remaining lines, regardless of your @pagelength setting.  
2

2
@more flush discards all remaining lines

MOO contains a rich programming language for the creation of interesting rooms, exits, and other objects.
2

2
Not every player is allowed to program in MOO, including (at the moment, anyway) you.  If you would like to be, find a wizard and convince them that you've got good ideas that the MOO needs.  Good luck!

         @wrap

         @linelength <number>
2
         @linelength
2

2
If the lines you see get cut off at the edge of your screen (you don't have
2
word-wrap), you can get the MOO to split lines for you.  The @linelength
2
command tells the MOO how many columns you have on your screen--you probably
2
want @linelength 79--and "@wrap on" tells the MOO you want it to do word-
2
wrap.
2

2
It's better if you can fix this problem without the MOO's help, though,
2
because the MOO's solution will be slower than a local solution, and
2
because not all MUDs are willing to do word-wrap.
2

2
If you don't want the MOO to split lines for you, there might still be some
2
use for the @linelength command.  Certain commands, like @who and @check,
2
print truncated lines so they can print in neat columns.  The default for
2
these is generally about 79 columns, which looks fine if you have an
2
eighty-column screen.  If your screen is a different width, though, you
2
can set @linelength and some of these commands will react accordingly.

Some things you should be aware of:
2

2
 -*-*- OMNISCIENT WIZARDS AND SYSADMINS: -*-*-
2
Wizards can look at absolutely *anything* in the MOO database.  
2
The arch-wizard and the sysadmin for the MOO-server host have complete access not only to the MOO database itself but to many other possibly-relevant things.
2
The above mentioned parties (wizards et al), while they will endeavor to be discreet about anything incidental that turns up, nevertheless reserve the right to look at anything they want, if only for the sake of being able to resolve technical problems.
2

2
 -*-*- LOGGING: -*-*- 
2
Some client programs (the "client" is the program you use to connect to the MOO, e.g., telnet, tinytalk, tinyfugue, emacs with mud.el...) are capable of logging everything that happens to the corresponding player.  In fact, with some clients this happens by default.  If a given player's client has logging enabled and said player is either in the room with you or is monitoring an object that is in the room with you, then *everything* you say and emote gets recorded.  Also, if you are in a room owned by someone else, all bets are off.  There is *no way* that the MOO server can know about what client a given player is using; thus, anyone who can hear you is a potential logger.
2

2
In and of itself this would not be a problem --- indeed, logs are often useful for reference purposes.  However, there is no guarantee that the log will not end up someplace where you'd rather it didn't, e.g., posted on the rec.games.mud Usenet newsgroup.  While it is considered bad form (i.e., rude) to circulate or post a log without having the permission of at least the major participants in the activities logged, there is not a whole lot we can do on the technical side to prevent it from happening.
2

2
Be aware of the problem.  The @sweep command (see `help @sweep') attempts to determine what players can be listening at any given moment.  If anything, it errs on the side of paranoia.  Even so, it doesn't cover *all* possible avenues of eavesdropping, and there's no hope for it covering the situations like the one where someone manages to convince one of the participants in your discussion who kept a log that it really doesn't need to be kept private after all.
2

2
If you've got something really sensitive to discuss, you are best off doing it by encrypted email or in person.

Syntax:  @examine <object>
2
         @exam <object>
2

2
Prints several useful pieces of information about the named object, including the following:
2
        + its full name, aliases, and object number
2
        + its owner's name and object number
2
        + its description
2
        + its key expression (if it is locked and if you own it)
2
        + its contents and their object numbers
2
        + the 'obvious' verbs defined on it
2

2
[Note to programmers: the 'obvious' verbs are those that are readable and that can be invoked as commands.  To keep a verb off this list, either make it unreadable (see 'help @chmod') or, if it shouldn't be used as a command, give it 'args' of 'this none this' (see 'help @args').]

2
There are several commands available to determine the origins of messages and to check that your communications with other players are secure. Help is available on the following topics:
2

2
@paranoid -- keeping a record of messages your character hears.
2
@check    -- looking at that record to determine responsibility for messages.
2
@sweep    -- checking who is listening in on your conversation.
36
5
4
3
2
Syntax: @sweep
2

2
Used when you wish to have a private conversation, and are concerned someone may be listening in. @sweep tries to list the avenues by which information may be leaving the room. In a manner analogous to @check, it assumes that you don't want to hear about your own verbs, or those belonging to wizards, who presumably wouldn't stoop to bugging.

2
Syntax:  @paranoid
2
         @paranoid off
2
         @paranoid immediate
2
         @paranoid <number>
2

2
In immediate mode, the monitor prepends everything you hear with the name of 
2
the character it considers responsible for the message. Otherwise, it keeps 
2
records of the last <number> (defaults to 10) lines you have heard. These 
2
records can be accessed by the @check command.
36
5
4
23
2
Syntax:   @check <options>
2

2
where <options> is one or more of:
2
-- the number of lines to be displayed
2
-- a player's name, someone to be "trusted" during the assignment of responsibility for the message.
2
-- a player's named prefixed by !, someone not to be "trusted".
2

2
          @check-full <options>
2
where <options is either 
2
-- the number of lines to be displayed
2
-- a search string: only lines containing that string will be displayed.
2

2
Used when you are suspicious about the origin of some of the messages your character has just heard.
2

2
Output from @check is in columns that contain, in order, the monitor's best guess as to:
2
    what object the message came from,
2
    what verb on that object that was responsible,
2
    whose permissions that verb was running with, and
2
    the beginning of the actual message.
2

2
Output from @check-full is in columns that contains a description of all the verbs that were responsible for the noise heard, not just the best guess as to who was responsible.
2

2
@check operates by examining the list of verbs that were involved in delivering the message, and assigning responsibility to the first owner it sees who is not "trusted".  By default, it trusts you and all the wizards.  It uses the records maintained by @paranoid, so you must have used that command before you received the message.
36

11
2
Syntax: @eject[!] <object> [from <place>]
2

2
This command is used to remove unwanted objects from places you own.  Players thus removed are unceremoniously dumped in their homes (unless that's this room, in which case they are dumped in the default player starting place).  Other kinds of objects are checked for a .home property and sent there if possible, otherwise they get thrown into #-1.  Unlike @move, @eject does *not* check to see if the object wants to be moved, and with the destination being what it is, there is no question of the destination refusing the move, either.  Generally, you should only resort to @eject if @move doesn't work.
2

2
`@eject <object>' removes <object> from the current room, whereas `@eject <object> from <place>' removes the object from the specified location (in most cases, <place> will need to be specified as an object number).  In either case, this command only works if you own the room/entity from which the object is being ejected.
2

2
`@eject ... from me' suffices to get rid of some unwanted object in your inventory.
2

2
The verbs @eject! and @eject!! are provided for those rare situations in which @eject does not work.  @eject! does not check for .home properties, sending the offending object to #-1 immediately, but with a notification.  @eject!! is just like @eject! but provides no notification to the object.
2

2
See 'help room-messages' for a list of messages one can set regarding the @eject command.

2
Syntax:  @quit
2

2
Disconnect from the MOO.  This breaks your network connection and leaves your player sleeping.  Disconnecting in most parts of the MOO automatically returns your player to its designated home (see 'help home').

Syntax:  whereis [<player> [<player>...]]

         @suggest [<text>]
2
         @idea    [<text>]
2
         @comment [<text>]
2

2
If <text> is given, a one-line message is sent to the owner of the room, presumably about something that you've noticed.  If <text> is not given, we assume you have more to say than can fit comfortably on a single line; the usual mail editor is invoked.  The convention is that @typo is for typographical errors on the room or objects found therein, @bug is for anomalous or nonintuitive behaviour of some sort, @idea/@suggest for any particular brainstorms or criticisms you might happen to have, and @comment for anything else.
2

2
If you're sending a bug report to someone because you got an error traceback when you used some object of theirs, please give them enough information to work on the problem.  In particular, please tell them *exactly* what you typed and *all* of the error messages that were printed to you, including the entire traceback, up to the line `(End of traceback.)'.  Without this information, it is nearly impossible for the programmer to discover, let alone fix, the problem.
2

2
The usual mail editor is only invoked for this command when in rooms that allow free entry, i.e., rooms that are likely to allow you back after you are done editing your message.  Otherwise these commands will require <text> and only let you do one-line messages.  
2
Most adventuring scenario rooms fall into this latter category.

Syntax:  @notedit <note-object>
2
         @notedit <object>.<property>
2

2
Enters the MOO Note Editor to edit the text on the named object
2
For the first form, <note-object> must be a descendant of $note.  
2
For the second form, <object>.<property> can be any string-valued or text-valued (i.e., list of strings) property on any object.
2

2
See 'help editors' for more detail.

2
One can always enter an editor by teleporting to it, or you can use one of the commands provided
2

2
    @edit     <object>:<verb>    invokes the Verb Editor (edits verb code)
2
    @notedit  <note_object>      invokes the Note Editor (edits note text)
2
    @notedit  <object>.<prop>    invokes the Note Editor (edits text property)
2
    @send     <list of recipients>        invokes the Mailer (edits a mail msg)
2
    @answer   [<msg_number>] [<flags>...] invokes the Mailer (edits a reply)
2

2
This will transport you to one of several special rooms that have editing commands available.  These editors are admittedly not as good as EMACS, but for those with no other editing capability on their host systems, they are better than nothing.
2

2
There is a generic editor that provides basic editing commands that are applicable to all editors.  Documentation for these commands can be obtained by typing `help <topic>' within the editor:
2

2
    abort              emote/:            pause              send      (M)

In addition, individual editors provide their own additional commands for loading text from places, saving text to places, and various other specialized functions which are denoted in the above list with (M),(N),(V) according as they apply to the mail editor, the note editor, or the verb editor, respectively.
2

2
Note that a given editor only allows you one session at a time (ie. one verb, one note, or one mail message).  If you leave an editor without either aborting or compiling/saving/sending the item you're working on, that editor remembers what you are doing next time you enter it, whether you enter it by teleporting or by using the appropriate command.  Note that editors are periodically flushed so anything left there for sufficiently long will eventually go away.
2

2
A player may have his own .edit_options property which is a list containing one or more (string) flags from the following list
2

2
  quiet_insert
2
      suppresses those annoying "Line n added." or "Appended..." messages
2
      that one gets in response to 'say' or 'emote'.  This is useful if you're
2
      entering a long list of lines, perhaps via some macro on your client,
2
      and you don't want to see an equally long list of "Line n added..."
2
      messages.  What you do want, however is some indication that this all
2
      got through, which is why the "." command is an abbreviation for insert.
2

2
  eval_subs
2
      Enables the verb editor to process your eval_subs property when
2
      compiling your verb.  See `help eval' for more information about
2
      the eval_subs property.
2

2
There will be more options, some day.

A letter is a special kind of note (see 'help notes') with the added feature that it can be recycled by anyone who can read it.  This is often useful for notes from one player to another.  You create the letter as a child of the generic letter, $letter (see 'help @create' and 'help write'), encrypt it so that only you and the other player can read it (see 'help encrypt') and then either give it to the player in question or leave it where they will find it.  Once they've read it, they can use the 'burn' command to recycle the letter; see 'help burn' for details.

2
The first two forms pick up the named object and place it in your inventory.  Sometimes the owner of the object won't allow it to be picked up for some reason.
2

2

List all of the messages that can be set on the named object and their current values.  See 'help messages' for more details.

67
2
Some kinds of messages are not printed directly to players; they are allowed to contain special characters marking places to include the appropriate pronoun for some player.  For example, a builder might have a doorway that's very short, so that people have to crawl to get through it.  When they do so, the builder wants a little message like this to be printed:
2

2
        Balthazar crawls through the little doorway, bruising his knee.
2

2
The problem is the use of 'his' in the message; what if the player in question is female?  The correct setting of the 'oleave' message on that doorway is as follows:
2

2
        "crawls through the little doorway, bruising %p knee."
2

2
The '%p' in the message will be replaced by either 'his', 'her', or 'its', depending upon the gender of the player.  
2

2
As it happens, you can also refer to elements of the command line (e.g., direct and indirect objects) the object issuing the message, and the location where this is all happening.  In addition one can refer to arbitrary string properties on these objects, or get the object numbers themselves.
2

2
The complete set of substitutions is as follows:
2

2
        %% => `%'  (just in case you actually want to talk about percentages).
2
    Names:
2
        %n => the player
2
        %t => this object (i.e., the object issuing the message,... usually)
2
        %d => the direct object from the command line
2
        %i => the indirect object from the command line
2
        %l => the location of the player
2
    Pronouns:
2
        %s => subject pronoun:          either `he',  `she', or `it'
2
        %o => object pronoun:           either `him', `her', or `it'
2
        %p => posessive pronoun (adj):  either `his', `her', or `its'  
2
        %q => posessive pronoun (noun): either `his', `hers', or `its'
2
        %r => reflexive pronoun:  either `himself', `herself', or `itself'
2
    General properties:
2
        %(foo) => player.foo 
2
        %[tfoo], %[dfoo], %[ifoo], %[lfoo]
2
               => this.foo, dobj.foo, iobj.foo, and player.location.foo
2
    Object numbers:
2
        %#  => player's object number
2
        %[#t], %[#d], %[#i], %[#l]
2
            => object numbers for this, direct obj, indirect obj, and location.
2

2
In addition there is a set of capitalized substitutions for use at the 
2
beginning of sentences.  These are, respectively, 
2

2
   %N, %T, %D, %I, %L for object names, 
2
   %S, %O, %P, %Q, %R for pronouns, and
2
   %(Foo), %[dFoo] (== %[Dfoo] == %[DFoo]),... for general properties
2

2
Note: there is a special exception for player .name's which are assumed to
2
already be capitalized as desired.
2

2
There may be situations where the standard algorithm, i.e., upcasing the first letter, yields something incorrect, in which case a "capitalization" for a particular string property can be specified explicitly.  If your object has a ".foo" property that is like this, you need merely add a ".fooc" (in general .(propertyname+"c")) specifying the correct capitalization.  This will also work for player .name's if you want to specify a capitalization that is different from your usual .name
2

2
Example:  
2
Rog makes a hand-grenade with a customizable explode message.
2
Suppose someone sets grenade.explode_msg to:
2

2
  "%N(%#) drops %t on %p foot.  %T explodes.  
2
   %L is engulfed in flames."
2

2
If the current location happens to be #3443 ("yduJ's Hairdressing Salon"),
2
the resulting substitution may produce, eg.,
2

2
  "Rog(#4292) drops grenade on his foot.  Grenade explodes.  
2
   YduJ's Hairdressing Salon is engulfed in flames."
2

2
which contains an incorrect capitalization.  
2
yduJ may remedy this by setting #3443.namec="yduJ's Hairdressing Salon".
2

2
Note for programmers:  
2
 In programs, use $string_utils:pronoun_sub().
2
 %n actually calls player:title() while %(name) refers to player.name directly.

2
Most objects have messages that are printed when a player succeeds or fails in manipulating the object in some way.  Of course, the kinds of messages printed are specific to the kinds of manipulations and those, in turn, are specific to the kind of object.  Regardless of the kind of object, though, there is a uniform means for listing the kinds of messages that can be set and then for setting them.
2

2
The '@messages' command prints out all of the messages you can set on any object you own.  Type 'help @messages' for details.
2

2
To set a particular message on one of your objects use a command with this form:
2
        @<message-name> <object> is "<message>"
2
where '<message-name>' is the name of the message being set, <object> is the name or number of the object on which you want to set that message, and <message> is the actual text.
2

2
For example, consider the 'leave' message on an exit; it is printed to a player when they successfully use the exit to leave a room.  To set the 'leave' message on the exit 'north' from the current room, use the command
2
        @leave north is "You wander in a northerly way out of the room."
2

2
[Note to programmers: This class of commands automatically applies to any property whose name ends in '_msg'.  Thus, in the example above, the command is setting the 'leave_msg' property of the named exit.  You can get such a command to work on new kinds of objects simply by giving the appropriate properties names that end in '_msg'.  Additionally, in many cases the _msg property is accompanied by a _msg verb, which defaultly returns the named property, but which is available to be customized in more complex ways than allowed by simple string substitution.  You should check for the particular property you're considering whether the verb form exists (typically with @list).]
2

2
The following help topics describe the uses of the various messages available on standard kinds of objects:
2

2
container-messages -- the messages on objects that can contain other objects
2
exit-messages -- the messages on exit objects
2
thing-messages -- the messages on objects that can be taken and dropped

Most objects have one or more descriptive pieces of text associated with them; these texts are printed under various circumstances depending on the kind of text.  For example, every object has a 'description' text that is printed whenever a player looks at the object.  The following help topics discuss the commands for manipulating these descriptive texts on your objects:
2

2
@rename -- setting the name and aliases of your objects
2
@describe -- setting what others see when they look at your objects
2
messages -- listing and setting the other descriptive texts on an object
36

4
13
2
Syntax:  @describe <object> as <description>
2

2
Sets the description string of <object> to <description>.  This is the string that is printed out whenever someone uses the 'look' command on <object>.  To describe yourself, use 'me' as the <object>.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin types this:
2
  @describe me as "A very fine fellow, if a bit on the short side."
2
People who type 'look Munchkin' now see this:
2
  A very fine fellow, if a bit on the short side.
2

2
Note for programmers:
2
The description of an object is kept in its .description property.  
2
For descriptions of more than one paragraph, .description can be a list of strings.

This is yduJ's table of tinymud commands and their equivalents in LambdaMOO.  A longer document, with discussions of the different verbs and how they have changed, is available via FTP from ftp.lambda.moo.mud.org as pub/MOO/contrib/docs/TinyMUD-LambdaMOO-equivs.  All the commands mentioned here have help nodes on LambdaMOO.
2

2
The following commands are basically the same in MOO and MUD.
2

2
    drop(throw), get(take), go, help, home, inventory, look, news, say (",:)
2

2

2
The following commands have no equivalent:
2

2
    kill, rob, score, @force
2

2

2
The following commands have the same names and do similar things, but are changed in some way (both syntactic and semantic differences, sometimes quite substantial differences):
2

2
    @examine, give, page, read, whisper, @create, @dig,
2
    @lock, @password, @unlock, @describe

Here are some commands for which no equivalent exists, or for which the equivalent is a complicated set of actions.
2

2
    @set, @stats, @unlink
2

2

2
Documentation on most of the LambdaMOO commands mentioned above can be acquired using 'help <command-name>'.  A notable exception is the commands like @oarrive and @take_failed that set textual messages on objects.  These are described under 'help messages'.

2
Syntax:  @gripe <anything> ...
2

2
Puts you into the MOO mail system to register a complaint (or, conceivably, a compliment) with the wizards.  The rest of the command line (the <anything> ... part) is used as the subject line for the message.  More information on using the MOO mail system is given once you're in it.
2

2
You may hear back from the wizards eventually; see 'help @mail' for how to read their reply.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin types:
2
  @gripe The little bird
2
  "How come I can't ever see the little bird in the cuckoo clock?
2
  "        -- A frustrated player
2

2
and, somewhat later, the wizards reply with a note about being sure to look while the clock is chiming.

         @gaglist [all]
2

2
Shows you a list of the players and objects currently on your 'gag list'.  You don't see any messages that result from actions initiated by the players or objects on this list.  In particular, you will not hear them if they try to speak, emote, or whisper to you.  See 'help gagging' for an explanation of gagging in general.  With the optional "all" parameter it will also scan the database for players who are gagging you.  This may induce lag, so caution is advised with this option.

2
Syntax:  @ungag <player or object>
2
         @ungag everyone
2

2
Remove the given player or object (or, in the second form, everyone) from your 'gag list'.  You will once again see any messages that result from actions initiated by the ungagged player(s) or objects.  In particular, you will once again be able to hear them if they speak, emote, or whisper to you.  See 'help gagging' for an explanation of gagging in general.
2

Example:
2
Munchkin types:
2
  @ungag Grover
2
and is once again able to hear Grover's witty remarks.  Sigh...
36

2
Syntax:  @gag <player or object> [<player or object>...]
2

2
Add the given players to your 'gag list'.  You will no longer see any messages that result from actions initiated by these players.  In particular, you will not hear them if they try to speak, emote, or whisper to you.  See 'help gagging' for an explanation of gagging in general.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin types:
2
  @gag Grover
2
and no longer hears anything that Grover says.  What a relief!
2

2
If you specify an object, then any text originating from that object will not be printed.  Example:  Noisy Robot prints "Hi there" every 15 seconds.   In order to avoid seeing that, Munchkin types:
2
  @gag Noisy
2
and no longer hears that robot!  (Munchkin must be in the same room as Noisy Robot for this to work, or know its object number.)

Syntax: go <direction> ...

Invokes the named exits in the named order, moving through many rooms in a single command.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin types:
2
  go n e e u e e s e
2
and moves quite rapidly from the Living Room all the way to the Bovine Illuminati Atrium, all in one command.

2
Syntax: @password <old-password> <new-password>
2

2
Changes your player's password (as typed in the 'connect' command when you log in to the MOO) to <new-password>.  For security reasons, you are required to type your current (soon to be old) password as the first argument.
2

2
Your password is stored in an encrypted form in the MOO database; in principle, not even the wizards can tell what it is, though they can change it, of course.  It is recommended that your password not be your name or a common word; MOO passwords have been stolen or cracked in the past and characters have been made unhappy by such theft.  Your password is your security; choose a safe one.
2

2
If your character does get stolen, a wizard can change it for you and tell you the new password in secret.  You may have to provide your email address for verification.
2

2
Only the first 8 characters of a password are significant.

2
Syntax: @sethome
2

2
Sets your designated home (see `help home') to be the room you're in now.  If the current room wouldn't allow you to teleport in, then the `@sethome' command nicely refuses to set your home there.  This avoids later, perhaps unpleasant, surprises.  Additionally, your home must be a room that will allow you to stay there.  Rooms which you own will do this, as will rooms to which you have been added as a resident.  See the @resident command for help on adding someone as a resident to a room you own.

*subst*
2
Syntax: @who
2
        @who <player> [<player> ... ]
2

2
The first form lists all of the currently-connected players, along with the amount of time they've been connected, the amount of time they've been idle, and their present location in the MOO.
2

2
The second form, in which a list of player names is given, shows information for just those players.  For any listed players that are not connected, we show the last login time instead of the connect/idle times.
2

2
@who refers to the @who_location message (see 'help messages') on each player's location in order to determine what should be printed in the location column.  Pronoun substitutions are done on this string in the usual manner (see 'help pronouns').  The default value is "%[$room.who_location_msg]" (i.e., the room name).
2

2
If the list of players to display is longer than 100, this command will not show its normal output, since it can be quite expensive to compute.  In such cases, you might want to use the @users command instead; see `help @users' for more information.

LambdaMOO is a kind of virtual reality, in which players move about from place to place manipulating their environment in what we hope are amusing, entertaining, or enlightening ways.
2

2
LambdaMOO is more of a pastime than a game in the usual sense; there is no `score' kept, there are no specific goals to attain in general, and there's no competition involved.  LambdaMOO participants explore the virtual world, talk to the other participants, try out the weird gadgets that others have built, and create new places and things for others to encounter and enjoy.

Most commands have the form of simple English sentences:
2
    <verb>
2
    <verb>  <direct object>
2
    <verb>  <direct object>  <preposition>  <indirect object>
2
Don't use English articles (e.g. 'a', 'an', or 'the') in your commands; the MOO won't understand them.  You can refer to yourself as 'me' and the room you're in as 'here'.
2

2
The first five kinds of commands you'll want to know are listed below.  Type 'help <topic-name>' for details on any of them:
2

2
look -- getting a description of the current room or any other object
2
say -- speaking to the other players in the same room as you
2
@who -- showing which players are currently connected to the MOO
2
movement -- how to move around in the MOO, from room to room
2
@quit -- disconnecting from the MOO

Syntax:  give <object> to <player>
2
         hand <object> to <player>
2

2
Move an object from your contents to that of another player.  This doesn't change the ownership of the object.  Some players may refuse to accept gifts and some objects may refuse to be given.

2
Syntax: news
2
        news all
2
        news new
2
        news contents
2
        news archive
2

2
Read the latest edition of the %[$network.MOO_name] Newspaper, which carries articles concerning recent changes to the MOO server or to the main public classes, or other articles of interest to the MOO at large.
2

2
The default behavior for the `news' command is to act like `news new' but this may be changed by setting the @mail-option news to one of `all' or `new' or `contents'.  `news all' displays all current news articles.  `news new' only displays articles you have not yet read.  `news contents' displays the authors and subjects of all current news.  `news archive' displays back issues of the newspaper which are deemed worth reading by every citizen at any time.

Occasionally, you may run into a situation in which you'd rather not hear from certain other players.  It might be that they're being annoying, or just that whatever they're doing makes a lot of noise.  Gagging a player will stop you from hearing the results of any task initiated by that player.  You can also gag a specific object, if you want to hear what the owner of that object says, but not the output from their noisy robot.  The commands to use gagging are listed below; detailed help is available on each of them:
2

2
@gag -- add one or more players to your gag list
2
@ungag -- remove a player from your gag list
2
@listgag -- list the players you currently have gagged
36

2
Syntax:  @move <thing> to <place>
2

2
Move the specified object to the specified location.  This is not guaranteed to work; in particular, the object must agree to be moved and the destination must agree to allow the object in.  This is usually the case, however.  The special case where <thing> is 'me' is useful for teleporting yourself around.
2

2
If @move doesn't work and you own the room where the object is located, try using @eject instead.
36

2
Syntax:  inventory
2
         i
2

2
Prints a list showing every object you're carrying.
36
5
4
8
2
Syntax: @gender <gender>
2
        @gender
2

2
The first form, with an argument, defines your player to have the gender <gender>.  If <gender> is one of the standard genders (e.g., 'male', 'female', 'neuter',...), your various pronouns will also be set appropriately, making exits and certain other objects behave more pleasantly for you.
2

2
The second form tells you the current definition of your player's gender, your current pronouns, and the complete list of standard genders.
2

2
It should be noted that some of the "genders" on the standard gender list need verb conjugation in order to work properly and much of the MOO isn't set up for this (...yet).  For example, you should expect to see `they is' a fair amount if you @gender yourself `plural'.
36
5
4
27
2
Syntax: @rename <object>        to [name-and-alias],<alias>,...,<alias>
2
        @rename <object>        to [name]:<alias>,...,<alias>
2
        @rename <object>.<property> to <new-property-name>
2
        @rename <object>:<verb-name> to <new-verb-name>
2
        @rename# <object>:<verb-number> to <new-verb-name>
2

2
The first two forms are used to change the name and aliases of an object. The name is what will be used in most printed descriptions of the object. The aliases are the names by which players can refer to the object in commands. Typically you want to include the name in the aliases, as the MOO parser only checks .aliases when matching, so the first syntax is generally preferred.
2

2
If you leave out the "name" part of the list, @rename will leave the object's name as it is, and only change the aliases.
2

2
Note that for renaming players, more stringent rules apply.  See `help player-names'.  Certain other kinds of objects (e.g., mail recipients) also enforce their own rules w.r.t what they can be named.
2

2
Examples:
2
Munchkin names his dog:
2
  @rename #4237 to "Rover the Wonder Dog":Rover,dog
2
Now we'll see 'Rover the Wonder Dog' if we're in the same room as him and we can refer to him as either 'Rover' or just 'dog' in our commands, like 'pet dog'.  Note, however, that it will be impossible to use "Rover the Wonder Dog" to rever to the dog: if you don't include the name in the aliases, confusion can result.  It might have been better to start off with
2
  @rename #4237 to "Rover the Wonder Dog",Rover,dog
2

2
Since he didn't, Munchkin now changes his dog's aliases:
2
  @rename #4237 to ,Rover,dog,Rover the Wonder Dog
2
The name remains the same--we still see 'Rover the Wonder Dog'--but now any of 'Rover', 'dog', or 'Rover the Wonder Dog' can be used to refer to him.  This can help reduce confusion.
2

2
The third form of the @rename command is also for use by programmers, to change the name of a property they own to <new-property-name>.
2

2
The fourth form of the @rename command is for use by programmers, to change the name of a verb they own. If the <new-verb-name> contains spaces, the verb will have multiple names, one for each space-separated word.
2

2
The fifth form, @rename#, is for unambiguously referring to a verb on an object in case there is more than one with the same name. The verb number is the 1-based index of the verb as it appears in the verbs() (or @verbs) output list.

2
Notes are objects that can have text written on them to be read later.  They are useful for leaving messages to people, or for documenting your creations.
2

2
The following help topics cover verbs that can be used with notes:
2

2
read -- reading the text on the note
2
write -- adding text to a note
2
erase -- removing all the text from a note
2
delete -- deleting one line of text from a note
2

2
@notedit -- general editing on the text of a note
2

2
encrypt -- restricting who can read a note
2
decrypt -- undoing a previous encryption
2

2
You can make a note by creating a child of the standard note, $note (see 'help @create').  Note that, like most objects, only the owner of a note can recycle it.  If you'd like to make it possible for a reader of your note to destroy it (this is a common desire for notes to other individual players), then you might want to look at 'help letters'.

2
Syntax: look
2
        look <object>
2
        look <object> in <container>
2

2
Show a description of something.
2

2
The first form, with no arguments, shows you the name and description of the room you're in, along with a list of the other objects that are there.
2

2
The second form lets you look at a specific object.  Most objects have descriptions that may be read this way.  You can look at your own description using 'look me'.  You can set the description for an object or room, including yourself, with the 'describe' command (see 'help describe').
2

2
The third form shows you the description of an object that is inside some other object, including objects being carried by another player.
36

2
Syntax:  drop <object>
2
         throw <object>

Objects usually have verbs defined on them that allow players to manipulate and use them in various ways. Standard ones are:
2

2
get  -- pick an object up and place it in your inventory
2
drop -- remove an object from your inventory and place it in the room
2
put  -- take an object from your inventory and place it in a container
2
give -- hand an object to some other player
2
look -- see what an object looks like
2

2
You can see what objects you're carrying with the 'inventory' command; see 'help inventory' for details.
2

2
Some specialized objects will have other commands. The programmer of the object will usually provide some way for you to find out what the commands are.  One way that works for most objects is the 'examine' command; see 'help examine' for details.
2

2
The following specialized objects have help entries you should consult:
2

2
notes -- objects that allow text to be written on them and read later
2
letters -- notes that a recipient can burn after reading
2
containers -- objects that may contain other objects
36

4
18
2
Syntax:  help
2
         help <topic>
2
         help index
2

2
Print out entries from the online documentation system.  The commands `?' and `information' (usually abbreviated `info') are synonyms for `help'.
2

2
The first form prints out a summary table of contents for the entire help system.  
2

2
The second form prints out the documentation available on the given topic.  Many help system entries contain references to other entries accessible in this way.  The topic name may be abbreviated; if there is no topic exactly matching the name you give, the help system checks for topics for which the name is a prefix, perhaps with the addition or omission of an initial `@', or perhaps with some confusion beween dashes (-) and underscores (_), e.g., 
2
      `bui' instead of `building', 
2
      `who' instead of `@who', 
2
     `@wri' instead of `write',
2
  `add_ent' instead of `@add-entrance',
2
 `unlock-'  instead of `@unlock_for_open'
2

2
If the abbreviation you give is ambiguous, you will be presented with a list of the matching complete topic names.
2

2
The `help index' commands prints out a list of indices for the various help databases.  Each index gives a list of topics available on that database.  It is sometimes easier to find the topics you're interested in this way, rather than tracing through the chain of cross references.

2
The descriptions of most rooms outline the directions in which exits exist.  Typical directions include the eight compass points ('north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'northeast', 'southeast', 'northwest', and 'southwest'), 'up', 'down', and 'out'.
2

2
To go in a particular direction, simply type the name of that direction (e.g, 'north', 'up').  The name of the direction can usually be abbreviated to one or two characters (e.g., 'n', 'sw').  You can also type 'go <direction>' to move; this is particularly useful if you know you're going to type several movement commands in a row (see 'help go').
2

2
In addition to such vanilla movement, some areas may contain objects allowing teleportation and almost all areas permit the use of the 'home' command to teleport you to your designated home (see 'help home' for more details).

*subst*
2
Syntax: home
2

2
Instantly teleports you to your designated home room.
2

2
You can change your designated home; see 'help @sethome' for details.

2
Syntax:  say <anything> ...
2
         "<anything> ...
2

2
Says <anything> out loud, so that everyone in the same room hears it.  This is so commonly used that there's a special abbreviation for it: any command-line beginning with a double-quote ('"') is treated as a 'say' command.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin types this:
2
  "This is a great MOO!
2
Munchkin sees this:
2
  You say, "This is a great MOO!"
2
Others in the same room see this:
2
  Munchkin says, "This is a great MOO!"
36

27
2
*subst*
2
Syntax:  page <player> [[with] <text>]
2

2
Sends a message to a connected player, telling them your location and, optionally, <text>.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin types:
2
        page Frebble with "Where are you?"
2
Frebble sees:
2
        You sense that Munchkin is looking for you in the Kitchen.
2
        He pages, "Where are you?"
2
Munchkin sees:
2
        Your message has been received.
2

2
Advanced Features:
2
Page refers to the following messages on the players involved (see 'help messages'):
2

2
@page_origin [%[$player.page_origin_msg]]
2
  Determines how the recipient is told of your location.
2

2
@page_echo   [%[$player.page_echo_msg]]
2
  Determines the response received by anyone who pages you.
2

2
@page_absent [%[$player.page_absent_msg]]
2
  Determines the response received by anyone who tries to page you when you aren't connected.
2

2
All of these undergo the usual pronoun substitutions (see 'help pronouns') except that in both cases the direct object (%d) refers to the recipent of the page and the indirect object (%i) refers to the sender.  You should only change these messages if you want to add to the Virtual Reality feel of the MOO for your character.

2
Syntax:  emote <anything> ...
2
         :<anything> ...
2
         ::<anything> ...
2

2
Announces <anything> to everyone in the same room, prepending your name.  This is commonly used to express various non-verbal forms of communication.  In fact, it is so commonly used that there's a special abbreviation for it: any command-line beginning with ':' is treated as an 'emote' command.
2

2
The alternate form, '::' (less commonly 'emote :'), does not insert the space between the player name and the text.
2

2
Examples:
2
Munchkin types this:
2
  :wishes he were much taller...
2
Everyone in the same room sees this:
2
  Munchkin wishes he were much taller...
2

2
Munchkin types this:
2
  ::'s eyes are green.
2
Everyone in the same room sees this:
2
  Munchkin's eyes are green.

Syntax:  @edit-option
2
         @edit-option <option>
2

2
Synonym:  @editoption
2

2
The edit options customize the behavior of the various editors (mail editor, verb editor, etc...) to your particular taste.  The first form of this command displays all of your edit options.  The second form displays just that one option, one of the flags listed below.
2

2
The remaining forms of this command are for setting your edit options:
2

2
         @edit-option +<flag>
2
         @edit-option -<flag>
2
         @edit-option !<flag>           (equivalent to -<flag>)
2

2
These respectively set and reset the specified flag
2

2
-quiet_insert    insert (") and append (:) echo back the line numbers
2
+quiet_insert    insert (") and append (:) produce no output
2
-eval_subs       (VERB EDITOR) ignore .eval_subs when compiling verbs
2
+eval_subs       (VERB EDITOR) apply .eval_subs to verbs being compiled
2
-local           Use in-MOO text editors.
2
+local           Ship text to client for local editing.
2
-no_parens       include all parentheses in verb code.
2
+no_parens       include only necessary parentheses in verb code.
2

2
+parens        is a synonym for -no_parens
2
+noisy_insert  is a synonym for -quiet_insert

2
Features are objects that provide you with commands not covered by the ordinary player objects.  The advantage of using features is that you can mix and match the things you like; whereas if you like a command that's defined on a player class, you have to also get all the commands it defines, and all the commands its ancestors define.
2

2
You can list your features with the @features command, and add or remove features from your list with the @add-feature and @remove-feature commands.

Syntax: @rmalias <alias>[,...,<alias>] from <object>
2
        @rmalias <alias>[,...,<alias>] from <object>:<verb-name>
2
        @rmalias# <alias>[,...,<alias>] from <object>:<verb-number>
2

2
The first form is used to remove aliases from an object.  If the object is a valid player, space and commas will be assumed to be separations between unwanted aliases.  Otherwise, only commas will be assumed to be separations.
2
Note that @rmalias will not affect the object's name, only its aliases.
2

2
The second form is for use by programmers, to remove aliases from a verb they own.  All spaces and commas are assumed to be separations between unwanted aliases.
2

2
The third form, @rmalias#, is for unambiguously referring to a verb on an object that might have more than one verb with the same name. The verb-number is the 1-based index of the verb as it appears in the verb() (or @verbs) output list.

Syntax: @addalias <alias>[,...,<alias>] to <object>
2
        @addalias <alias>[,...,<alias>] to <object>:<verb-name>
2
        @addalias# <alias>[,...,<alias>] to <object>:<verb-number>
2

2
The first form is used to add aliases to an object's list of aliases.  You can separate multiple aliases with commas.  The aliases will be checked against the object's current aliases and all aliases not already in the object's list of aliases will be added.
2

2
Example:
2
Muchkin wants to add new aliases to Rover the Wonder Dog:
2
  @addalias Dog,Wonder Dog to Rover
2
Since Rover the Wonder Dog already has the alias "Dog" but does not have the alias "Wonder Dog", Munchkin sees:
2
  Rover the Wonder Dog(#4237) already has the alias Dog.
2
  Alias Wonder Dog added to Rover the Wonder Dog(#4237).
2

2
If the object is a player, spaces will also be assumed to be separations between aliases and each alias will be checked against the Player Name Database to make sure no one else is using it. Any already used aliases will be identified.  Certain other classes of objects (e.g., mail-recipients) also enforce rules about what aliases may be given them.
2

2
Example:
2
Munchkin wants to add his nicknames to his own list of aliases:
2
  @addalias Foobar Davey to me
2
@Addalias recognizes that Munchkin is trying to add an alias to a valid player and checks the aliases against the Player Name Database.  Unfortunately, DaveTheMan is already using the alias "Davey" so Munchkin sees:
2
  DaveTheMan(#5432) is already using the alias Davey
2
  Alias Foobar added to Munchkin(#1523).
2

2
The second form of the @addalias command is for use by programmers, to add aliases to a verb they own.  All commas and spaces are assumed to be separations between aliases.
2

2
The third form, @addalias#, is for unambiguously referring to a verb on an object in case there are more than one with the same name. The verb number is the 1-based index of the verb as it appears in the verbs() (or @verbs) output list.

Help is available on the following commands:
2
@rename -- change the names or aliases of an object or yourself.
2
@addalias, @rmalias -- add and remove aliases.

A player name must be a single word, must not contain any spaces, backslashes, or quotes, nor can it begin with the characters #, *, (, or ).  Finally it cannot be one that is in use by any other player nor any of the words on the following list:
2

2
%;;lns={};for l in ($string_utils:columnize({@$player_db.stupid_names,@$player_db.reserved},6)) lns={@lns,"  "+l}; endfor return lns;
2

2
Note that these rules apply as well to your single-word aliases, since those can equally well be used to refer to you in commands that match on player names (@who, whereis, ...).  There are no restrictions on your multi-word aliases, however the commands that expect player names will not recognize them.

  @registerme as <email-address>
2
This verb changes your registered email_address property. It will modify the registration, and then, to validate the email address, it will assign a new password and mail the password to the given email_address.
2
If, for some reason, this is a problem for you, contact a wizard or registrar to get your email address changed.

Enters a MOO editor, as appropriate.
2

2
Chooses the MOO Note editor for the named property, or the MOO verb editor for the named verb.  If no property or verb name is given, assumes property .text for a note object, or .description for any other object.

There are several commands available to allow you to communicate with your fellow MOOers.  Help is available on the following communication-related topics:
2

2
say      -- talking to the other connected players in the room
2
whisper  -- talking privately to someone in the same room
2
page     -- yelling to someone anywhere in the MOO
2
emote    -- non-verbal communication with others in the same room
2
gagging  -- screening out noise generated by certain other players
2
news     -- reading the wizards' most recent set of general announcements
2
@gripe   -- sending complaints to the wizards
2
@typo @bug @idea @suggest
2
         -- sending complaints/ideas to the owner of the current room
2
whereis  -- locating other players
2
@who     -- finding out who is currently logged in
2
mail     -- the MOO email system
2
security -- the facilities for detecting forged messages and eavesdropping.

Objects are the fundamental building blocks of the MOO.  Every object has a unique number, a name, an owner, a location, and various other properties.  An object can always be referred to by its number, and sometimes by its name or one of its aliases -- if you are in the same location as the object, for example, and also in some other special cases.
2

2
For help on creating an object, see 'help @create'.
2

2
For help on recycling an object, see 'help @recycle'.
2

2
For help on finding information about specific objects, see 'help @display', 'help @show', and 'help $object_utils'.
36

5
2
Every object on the MOO (players included) has a list of aliases, or names by which it can be referred.  This is useful when an object has a nice long descriptive name that you don't want to have to type every time you refer to it.
2

2
Typing `exam object' will show you its aliases.  If you are a programmer, you can type `#<object>.aliases', using an object's number, or `#Munchkin.aliases p'.  (The `p' indicates that the prefix is a player's name.)

Players sometimes have difficulty getting their backspace key to work.  This is an outside-MOO problem:  Whatever access software you have determines how the line you type is edited before the MOO ever sees it.  If your backspace key won't work here, you will probably need to consult with some documentation or a guru at your end.
2

2
The above notwithstanding, here are a few things to try instead of backspace:
2

2
   ctrl-h            (another way of typing backspace)
2
   del               (delete character)
2
   ctrl-backspace    (another way of typing delete character)
2
   ctrl-w            (delete word left)
2
   ctrl-u            (delete entire line)
2
   ctrl-r            (redraw line)

The spivak pronouns were developed by mathematician Michael Spivak for use in his books.  They are the most simplistic of the gender neutral pronouns (others being "neuter" and "splat") and can be easily integrated into writing.  They should be used in a generic setting where the gender of the person referred to is unknown, such as "the reader."  They can also be used to describe a specific individual who has chosen not to identify emself with the traditional masculine (male) or feminine (female) gender.
2

2
The spivak pronouns are
2
E      - subjective
2
Em     - objective
2
Eir    - possessive (adjective)
2
Eirs   - possessive (noun)
2
Emself - reflexive

Usage: @owner object
2

2
Displays the specified object, its object number, and its owner (and its owner's object number).

Checkpointing refers to process by which the MOO makes a backup copy of itself.  Because the computer that's running the MOO has to simultaneously handle two copies of itself, this results in a period of high lag for the MOO users.  So, why do we put up with this?
2

2
Every successful checkpoint results in a database of what the MOO was like at that point in time.  All the MOOmail, mailing lists, objects, descriptions, properties, and verbs on all of the MOO are frozen in time and stored.  In the event that the MOO crashes (due to a power failure or the like), this checkpoint database can be used to restart the MOO with much of our recent work intact.  This is a very good thing.
2

2
Checkpointing is a global backup.  Do not rely on the checkpoint database to back up your own work!  Archive your code, properties, and objects offline to ensure their safety.  Each successful checkpoint overwrites the previous day's checkpoint, so it is an unreliable means of recovering lost data.  Some of these checkpoints do get backed up quarterly, but these are not available without inconveniencing the MOO populace as a whole.

The object $help is the main help database.  For every help topic there is a corresponding property on $help, interpreted as follows:
2

2
$help.(topic) = string           - one-line help text.
2
$help.(topic) = {"*verb*",@args} - call this:verb(args,{}) to get text
2
$help.(topic) = any other list   - multi-line help text
2

2
There is also a "" property which applies in the case of `help' typed without any arguments.
2

2
See the description of $generic_help for more detail.

Welcome to LambdaCore
2

2
Getting Started with your LambdaCore MOO
2
========================================
2

2
Thank you for choosing LambdaCore!
2

2
Initial Setup Notes
2
-------------------
2

2
The "welcome" screen, seen when a player connects.
2
  -- this is stored in $login.welcome_message
2

2
Do you want on-line character creation?
2
  -- this is stored in $login.create_enabled
2
     for more detailed information, edit $login:player_creation_enabled
2

2
Do you want to limit the number of players on the MOO at once?
2
  -- look at $login.max_connections
2
     the `connection_limit' message on $login is the message printed
2
     when this limit is reached.
2

2
Do you want a different default player class?
2
  -- set $player_class to a different value
2
     *do not* change $player
2

2
You should also set the following:
2
  $network.postmaster
2
    -- your email address, or the email address of the person who will 
2
       handle your email
2
  $network.site
2
    -- the machine your MOO is running on (e.g. "lambda.moo.mud.org")
2
  $network.port
2
    -- the port your MOO is running on (e.g. 8888)
2
  $network.MOO_Name
2
    -- the name of your MOO (e.g. "LambdaMOO")
2
  $site_db.domain
2
  -- this is set to the `domain' of your address
2
     (eg `foo.com' for `moo.foo.com')
2

2
If you compiled the server with open_network_connection() enabled (allowing the MOO to open up connections with other computers on the network), then you should set
2
  $network.active = 1
2
     This will enable @newpassword, @registerme, @password, @mailme, @netforward, and others to send mail from the MOO.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Setting Yourself Up
2
-------------------
2

2
Set a password for yourself.
2
  -- @password <new-password>
2

2
Set a description for yourself.
2
  -- @describe me as <anything>
2

2
Set a gender for yourself.
2
  -- @gender <gender>
2

2
There are, also, a large number of messages you can set on yourself.  Setting them will enhance the virtual reality.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
About Guests
2
------------
2

2
To make a new Guest character:
2
  -- @make-guest <guestname>
2
     will make a new guest with the name you specify with `_Guest' appended
2
     and some other standard but useful aliases
2

2
This is the easiest way to make Guest characters.  The most important things to remember about Guests, if you want to make them yourself, are:
2
  -- make them owned by nonwizards, and not owned by themselves
2
  -- make sure they've got .password == 0, and that .password is nonclear
2
  -- at least one Guest must always be named `Guest'; this can be an alias
2

2
To set the default description and gender for a guest:
2
  -- set .default_description to the description the guest should start with
2
  -- set .default_gender to the gender the guest should start with
2
  -- remember to set .description and .gender too, for the guest's first use
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Adding to the Newspaper
2
-----------------------
2

2
The newspaper is a special mailing list.  To add a post to the newspaper, send mail to it (as *News or $news), and then note the number of your post (let's call it <x> and:
2
  -- @addnews <x> to *News
2
... in general, `@addnews $ to *News' will work as well.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Quota
2
-----
2

2
By default, LambdaCore runs with byte-based quota, an in-DB quota system, limiting users by total database space as opposed to total objects.  You'll need to do two things:
2
  -- decide on the default quota:
2
     ;$byte_quota_utils.default_quota[1] = <a number of bytes>
2
  -- start the measurement task; see `help routine_tasks' for more information (Note: this help topic contains information about more than just the quota task; it should be read regardless of how quota is set).
2

2
If you prefer the quota system documented in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual, directly supported by the server, you can enable object-based quota:
2
  -- set $quota_utils to $object_quota_utils
2

2
It's best that you make this switch before users start, because converting existing users is an awkward (and inherently arbitrary and political) move.
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2

2
Making Programmers
2
------------------
2

2
The command to turn someone into a programmer is `@programmer'  Its syntax is `@programmer <user>'.  For example:
2
  -- @programmer Haakon
2
The `@programmer' verb will prompt you if the user isn't set up with a description and a gender.
2

2
No code to automatically grant programmer bits is included with LambdaCore.
2

2
Making Wizards
2
--------------
2

2
THINK CAREFULLY.
2

2
Be very careful before giving someone a wizard bit.  That person can do gross damage to your database, and fixable but serious damage to the machine it runs on.  That person can quite possibly open outbound network connections from your machine, and thus commit acts for which your host system will be blamed.  That person can ruin your MOO's as-yet-untarnished reputation.
2

2
Wizards have technical power, the ability to change anything within the database, to create anything within the database.  Be careful with the idea of a `Social Wizard' -- a nontechnical person holding a wizard bit is fairly likely to, at some point, accidentally do something destructive.  It's a good idea not to socialize as your wizard character, for the same reason, to make it less likely to be accidentally destructive.
2

2
That said, in general you don't turn an existing character into a wizard, you make a -new- character to be the wizard.  This is because the existing character probably owns code and objects which could be destructive if suddenly made wizardly; it's a good security measure to make a fresh player.  So, to make a fresh player:
2
  -- @make-player (see `help @make-player' for more information)
2
     this will make you a new player. for this example, #123
2

2
To make #123 a wizard:
2
  -- @programmer #123
2
     (a nonprogrammer wizard is a truly strange beast)
2
  -- ;#123.wizard = 1;
2
  -- @chparent #123 to $wiz
2
  -- ;#123.public_identity = <the player's nonwizard character's object number>
2

2
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Object reuse. Call $recycler:_create() to create an object (semantics the same as create()), $recycler:_recycle() to recycle an object. Will create a new object if nothing available in its contents. Note underscores, to avoid builtin :recycle() verb called when objects are recycled. Uses $building_utils:recreate() to prepare objects.

Utilities for dealing with network connections
2
---------------
2
Creating & tracking hosts:
2

2
:open(host, port [, connect-connection-to]) => connection
2
    open a network connection (using open_network_connection).
2
    If 'connect-connection-to' is a player object, the
2
    connection will be connected to that object when it
2
    gets the first line of input.
2

2
:close(connection)
2
     closes the connection & cleans up data
2

2
------------------
2
Parsing network things:
2

2
:invalid_email_address(email)
2
     return "" or string saying why 'email' is invalid.
2
     uses .valid_email_regexp
2

2
:invalid_hostname(host)
2
     return "" or string saying why 'host' doesn't look
2
     like a valid internet host name
2

2
:local_domain(host)
2
     returns the 'important' part of a host name, e.g.
2
     golden.parc.xerox.com => parc.xerox.com
2

2
-------------------
2
Sending mail
2

2
:sendmail(to, subject, @lines)
2
     send mail to the email address 'to' with indicated subject.
2
     header fields like 'from', 'date', etc. are filled in.
2
     lines can start with additional header lines.
2

2
:raw_sendmail(to, @lines)
2
     used by :sendmail. Send mail to given user at host, just
2
     as specified, no error checking.
2

2
================================================================
2
Parameters:
2

2
.active If 0, disabled sending of mail.
2

2
.site   Where does this MOO run?
2
        (Maybe MOOnet will use it later).
2

2
.port   The network port this MOO listens on.

.large_domains 
2
        A list of sites where more than 2 levels of host name are
2
        significant, e.g., if you want 'parc.xerox.com' to be
2
        different than 'cinops.xerox.com', put "xerox.com" as an
2
        element in .large_domains.
2

2
.postmaster
2
        Email address to which problems with MOO mail should
2
        go. This should be a real email address that someone reads.
2

2
.maildrop
2
        Hostname to connect to for dropping off mail. Usually can
2
        just be "localhost".
2

2
.reply_address
2
        If a MOO character sends email, where does a reply go?
2
        Inserted in 'From:' for mail from characters without
2
        registration addresses.        
2

2
.trusts
2
        List of (non-wizard) programmers who can call

This is the object you want to use as a parent in order to @create a place for your biglists to live.  Suitably sick souls may wish to reimplement :_genprop and :_kill to reclaim unused properties (this :_kill just throws them away and this :_genprop just relentlessly advances....  who cares).  Anyway, you'll need to look at $biglist before this will make sense.

Verbs a user might want to call from a program:
2
 :bi_create -- built-in create() call, takes same args.
2

2
 :get_quota(who) -- just get the raw size_quota property
2
 :display_quota(who) -- prints to player the quota of who.  If caller_perms() controls who, include any secondary characters.  Called by @quota.
2
 :get_size_quota(who [allchars]) -- return the quota of who, if allchars flag set, add info from all secondary chars, if caller_perms() permits.
2

2
 :value_bytes(value) -- computes the size of the value.
2
 :object_bytes(object) -- computes the size of the object and caches it.
2
 :recent_object_bytes(object, days) -- computes and caches the size of object only if cached value more than days old.  Returns cached value.
2
 :do_summary(user) -- prints out the results of summarize-one-user.
2
 :summarize_one_user(user) -- summarizes and caches space usage for user.  See verb help for details.
2

2
Verbs the system calls:
2
 :"creation_permitted verb_addition_permitted property_addition_permitted"(who) -- returns true if who is permitted to build.
2
 :initialize_quota(who) -- sets quota for newly created players
2
 :adjust_quota_for_programmer(who) -- empty; might add more quota to newly @progged player.
2
 :enable_create(who) -- sets .ownership_quota to 1
2
 :disable_create(who) -- sets .ownership_quota back to -1000 to prohibit create()
2
 :charge_quota(who, object) -- subtract the size of object from who's quota.  Manipulates the #-unmeasured if what is not currently measured.  Called by $wiz_utils:set_owner.
2
 :reimburse_quota(who, object) -- add the size of object to who's quota.  Ditto.
2
 :preliminary_reimburse_quota(who, object) -- Because the set_owner is done *after* an object has been turned into $garbage, ordinary reimbursement fails.  So we use this verb in the $recycler.
2
 :set_quota(who, howmuch)
2
 :quota_remaining(who) 
2
 :display_quota_summary -- internal, called by display quota
2

2
The measurement task:
2

2
 :measurement_task() -- runs once every 24 hours measuring stuff, separated from the scheduling in case you just want to run it once.  Calls the body and then reports via moomail.
2
 :schedule_measurement_task() -- actually schedules it.  Look here to change the start time.
2
 :measurement_task_body(timeout) -- does the real work, working for no longer than timeout seconds.
2
 .task_time_limit -- integer number of seconds indicating for how long it should run each day.
2
 .working -- object indicating the player whom it is either working on now (or if not running) will pick up working on when it commences tonight.
2
 .cycle_days -- integer numbers indicating how long ago an object must have been measured before it will be remeasured.
2
 .repeat_cycle -- boolean.  0 means have a vanilla cycle (goes through all players() exactly once measuring their objects measured more than .cycle_days ago).  1 means to have a much more complex algorithm: The first cycle, it only measures stuff owned by people who have logged in within .cycle_days.  If, in .task_time_limit seconds, it measures all objects not measured in cycle_days owned by such people, it will run again measuring those objects which have not been measured in cycle_days - 1, considering people who have logged in within 4 * cycle_days, repeating until it has used up its seconds.  ("Doing some of tomorrow's work.")  Selecting .repeat_cycle = 1 is appropriate only for large MOOs.
2
 .exempted -- list of objects to never measure (useful if there are huge objects).  Suggested huge objects include $player_db and $site_db.
2
 .measurement_task -- indicates the task_id() of the most recent measurement task -- used to prevent duplicate invocation.
2
 .report_recipients -- recipients of the daily reports.  Set to {} to disable reporting entirely.
2

2
See help @measure and help @quota for the command line verbs.
2

2

2
Porter's notes:  If you are planning on porting this system to another MOO, here are the things to grab in addition to @dumping all of $quota_utils:
2

2
The following verbs have been changed on $prog:
2
@prop*erty @verb @copy (@add-alias @copy-move as well)
2

2
The following verbs have been changed on $wiz:
2
@programmer @quota
2

2
The following verbs have been changed on $wiz_utils:
2
set_programmer set_owner make_player
2

2
The following verbs have been changed on $builder:
2
@quota _create
2

2
This verb probably should have gone on $builder.
2
@measure
2

2
The followig verbs have been changed on $recycler
2
_recycle _create setup_toad
2

2
The following verb has been changed on $login:
2
create
2

2
And don't forget $object_quota_utils, which has the object based implementation.

2
This object stores the @paranoid data from :tell.  Normally it is not necessary to access these things directly.  All verbs are controlled by a caller_perms() check.  All data is stored in the old .responsible format.
2

2
:add_data(who,data) adds one line's worth of data to the collection, trimming from the front as necessary.
2

2
:get_data(who) retrieves the entire batch of data.
2

2
:erase_data(who) sets the data to {}
2

2
:set_kept_lines(who,number) Changes the number of kept lines.  Maximum is 20.
2

2
Core verbs that call the above are this are $player:tell, @check, @paranoid, and :erase_paranoid_data.
2

2
Internal:  
2
   Properties used are
2
   tostr(player)+"lines"
2
   tostr(player)+"pdata"
2
   :ensure_props_exist(who,linesname,dataname):  creates the above
2
   :GC() --- loops over all data and verifies they're for players.

                Server Options <$server_options>

                --------------------------------
2

2
messages: 'boot_msg', 'connect_msg', 'create_msg', 'recycle_msg', 'redirect_from_msg', 'redirect_to_msg', and 'timeout_msg'.
2
A number of the messages printed to a connection by the server under various circumstances can now be customized or eliminated from within the DB.  In each case, a property on $server_options is checked at the time the message would be printed.  If the property does not exist, the standard message is printed.  If the property exists and its value is not a string, then no message is printed at all.  Otherwise, the string is printed in place of the standard message.  The following list covers all of the newly customizable messages, showing for each the name of the relevant property on $server_options, the default/standard message, and the circumstances under which the message is printed:
2
'boot_msg'              "*** Disconnected ***"
2
The function boot_player() was called on this connection.
2
'connect_msg'           "*** Connected ***"
2
The user object that just logged in on this connection existed before #0:do_login_command() was called.
2
'create_msg'            "*** Created ***"
2
The user object that just logged in on this connection did not exist before #0:do_login_command() was called.
2
'recycle_msg'           "*** Recycled ***"
2
The logged-in user of this connection has been recycled.
2
'redirect_from_msg'     "*** Redirecting connection to new port ***"
2
The logged-in user of this connection has just logged in on some other connection.
2
'redirect_to_msg'       "*** Redirecting old connection to this port ***"
2
The user who just logged in on this connection was already logged in on some other connection.
2
'timeout_msg'           "*** Timed-out waiting for login. ***"
2
This in-bound network connection was idle and un-logged-in for at least CONNECT_TIMEOUT seconds (as defined in options.h).
2

2
Note: on a 1.8rN server, changes to $server_options will not take effect until load_server_options() has been called.
2

2

2
Some properties on $server_options can change the server behavior:
2

2
'bg_seconds', 'bg_ticks', 'fg_seconds', and 'fg_ticks'.
2
If those properties exist and are numbers, the server use them instead of the constants DEFAULT_BG_SECONDS, DEFAULT_BG_TICKS, DEFAULT_FG_SECONDS and DEFAULT_FG_TICKS (respectively) defined at compile time in "options.h"; they are looked up anew every time a task begins or resumes execution. Those define ticks (basic operations)/real-time seconds any task is allowed to use without suspending. 'fg' constants/properties are used only for 'foreground' tasks (those started by either player input or the server's initiative and that have never suspended); the 'bg' constants/properties are used only for 'background' tasks (forked tasks and those of any kind that have suspended).
2

2
'max_stack_depth' This allow to change in-db the the maximum verb-call depth. Originillay the maximum verb-call depth is defined at compile time by the DEFAULT_MAX_STACK_DEPTH constant in "options.h". The maximum stack depth for any task is set at the time that task is created and cannot be changed thereafter. This implies that suspended tasks, even after being saved in and restored from the DB, are not affected by later changes to $server_options.max_stack_depth. 
2

2
'queued_task_limit' if this property exist and its value is non-negative, then it is used as the maximum of tasks a verb-owner (more exactly the user's perms the verb run with) can queue (through fork() and suspend()). This setting is overriden if the user has a 'queued_task_limit' property and if its value is non-negative. E_QUOTA is raised of either forking or suspending when the user is over quota for tasks.
2

2
'protect_...' On every call to a built-in function 'foo', if the property $server_options.protect_foo exists and is true, and the programmer is not a wizard, then the server checks for the existence of #0:bf_<fuction> and calls that. If it doesn't exist then E_PERM is raised, i.e. the built-in function is made wiz-only.
2

2
'no_name_lookup' If this property exists and is true, the server will no longer automatically handle DNS name lookups. Instead, you'll have to use the 'connection_name_lookup()' function. This has the advantage of performing name lookups in a separate thread (thus not locking the main MOO until it finishes), but it also has the disadvantage of preventing '#0:do_login_command()' from working properly. To mitigate this, you must use the 'switch_player()' function instead of returning an object number. Note that this is the default behavior of ToastCore.

Syntax:  @sort-owned  [ object | size ]
2

2
Sorts your .owned_objects property so @audit shows up sorted.  See help @audit for more information.
2

2
@sort-owned object will sort by object number (the default).  @sort-owned size will sort by size of object as periodically recorded.
36

2
Syntax:  @verify-owned

2
Syntax:  @add-owned <object>
2

2
Adds an object to your .owned_objects property in case it managed not to get updated properly upon creation of that object.  Checks to ensure that the objects is really owned by you and otherwise belongs in your .owned_objects property.  See help @audit for more information.
36

2
Usage: @recreate <object> as <parent> named <name spec>
2

2
This is a combination of @create and @chparent.  It takes an existing object, completely strips it of any verbs, properties, and values for inherited properties.  This object is then reshaped into a child of the parent specified, as though @create had been called, but retaining the same object number as the original.
2

2
You may use "called" instead of "named" in this command, if you wish.
2

2
The <parent> and <name spec> arguments are as in @create.

2
Syntax:  @parents object
2

2

2

2
Example:
2
  @parents Haakon
2
  Haakon(#2)   generic wizard(#218)   generic programmer(#217)   generic 
2
  player(#6)   Root Class(#1)

Syntax:  @contents object
2

2
A quick way to find out the contents of an object.  Prints out the names and object numbers of all direct contents.  This can be useful when you need to refer to something by object number because something is wrong with its aliases.
2

2
Example:
2
  @contents here

The representation of key expressions is very simple and makes it easy to construct new keys on the fly.
2

2
Objects are represented by their object numbers and all other kinds of key expressions are represented by lists.  These lists have as their first element a string drawn from the following set:
2
        "&&"     "||"     "!"     "?"
2
For the first two of these, the list should be three elements long; the second and third elements are the representations of the key expressions on the left- and right-hand sides of the appropriate operator.  In the third case, "!", the list should be two elements long; the second element is again a representation of the operand.  Finally, in the "?" case, the list is also two elements long but the second element must be an object number.
2

2
As an example, the key expression
2
        #45  &&  ?#46  &&  (#47  ||  !#48)
2
would be represented as follows:
2
        {"&&", {"&&", #45, {"?", #46}}, {"||", #47, {"!", #48}}}

LambdaMOO supports a simple but powerful notation for specifying locks on objects, encryption on notes, and other applications.  The idea is to describe a constraint that must be satisfied concerning what some object must be or contain in order to use some other object.
2

2
The constraint is given in the form of a logical expression, made up of object numbers connected with the operators 'and', 'or', and 'not' (written '&&', '||', and '!', for compatibility with the MOO programming language).  When writing such expressions, though, one usually does not use object numbers directly, but rather gives their names, as with most MOO commands.
2

2
These logical expressions (called 'key expressions') are always evaluated in the context of some particular 'candidate' object, to see if that object meets the constraint.  To do so, we consider the candidate object, along with every object it contains (and the ones those objects contain, and so on), to be 'true' and all other objects to be 'false'.
2

2
As an example, suppose the player Munchkin wanted to lock the exit leading to his home so that only he and the holder of his magic wand could use it.  Further, suppose that Munchkin was object #999 and the wand was #1001.  Munchkin would use the '@lock' command to lock the exit with the following key expression:
2
        me || magic wand
2
and the system would understand this to mean
2
        #999 || #1001
2
That is, players could only use the exit if they were (or were carrying) either #999 or #1001.
2

2
To encrypt a note so that it could only be read by Munchkin or someone carrying his book, his bell, and his candle, Munchkin would use the 'encrypt' command with the key expression
2
        me || (bell && book && candle)
2

2
Finally, to keep players from taking a large gold coffin through a particularly narrow exit, Munchkin would use this key expression:
2
        ! coffin
2
That is, the expression would be false for any object that was or was carrying the coffin.
2

2
There is one other kind of clause that can appear in a key expression:
2
        ? <object>
2
This is evaluated by testing whether the given object is unlocked for the candidate object; if so, this clause is true, and otherwise, it is false.  This allows you to have several locks all sharing some single other one; when the other one is changed, all of the locks change their behavior simultaneously.
2

2
[Note to programmers: The internal representation of key expressions, as stored in .key on every object, for example, is very simple and easy to construct on the fly.  For details, see 'help key-representation'.]

2
Syntax:  @lock <object> with <key expression>
2

2
Set a lock on <object> to restrict its use.  See 'help locking' for general information about locking and 'help keys' for the syntax and semantics of key expressions.
2

2
N.B.  In the case of rooms, you are actually better off setting room.free_entry to 0 thus preventing teleportation and then @locking the various entrances.  The problem with @locking the room itself is that this can make it impossible to drop objects in the room.
36

21
2
It is frequently useful to restrict the use of some object.  For example, one might want to keep people from using a particular exit unless they're carrying a bell, a book, and a candle.  Alternatively, one might allow anyone to use the exit unless they're carrying that huge golden coffin in the corner.  LambdaMOO supports a general locking mechanism designed to make such restrictions easy to implement, usually without any programming.
2

2
Every object supports a notion of being 'locked' with respect to certain other objects.  For example, the exit above might be locked for any object that was carrying the coffin object but unlocked for all other objects.  In general, if some object 'A' is locked for another object, 'B', then 'B' is usually prevented from using 'A'.  Of course, the meaning of 'use' in this context depends upon the kind of object.
2

2
The various standard classes of objects use locking as follows:
2
  + Rooms and containers refuse to allow any object inside them if they're locked for it.
2
  + Exits refuse to transport any object that they're locked for.
2
  + Things (including notes and letters) cannot be moved to locations that they're locked for.
2

2
There are two sides to locking:
2
  + How is it specified whether one object is locked for another one?
2
  + What is the effect of an object being locked?
2
Note that these two questions are entirely independent: one could invent a brand-new way to specify locking, but the effect of an exit being locked would be unchanged.
2

2
[Note to programmers: the interface between these two sides is the verb x:is_unlocked_for(y), which is called by x to determine if it is locked for the object y.  The way in which 'is_unlocked_for' is implemented is entirely independent of the ways in which x uses its results.  Note that you can play on either side of this interface with your own objects, either defining new implementations of 'is_unlocked_for' that match your particular circumstances or having your objects interpret their being locked in new ways.]
2

2
There is a default way to specify locks on objects; the following help topics cover the relevant commands:
2

2
@lock -- setting a lock on an object
2
@unlock -- clearing the lock on an object
2
keys -- describes the language used to describe lock keys
36

2
Syntax:  @classes
2
         @classes <class-name> ...
2

2
The wizards have identified several useful classes of objects in the database.  The @classes command is used to see which classes exist and what their member objects are.
2

2
The first form simply lists all of the defined classes along with short descriptions of the membership of each.
2

2
The second form prints an indented listing of that subset of the object parent/child hierarchy containing the objects in the class(es) you specify.
36
1
4
27
2
Syntax:  @audit [<player>] [for <string>] [from <number>] [to <number>] 
2

2
`@audit'        prints a report of all of the objects you own.
2
`@audit player' prints the same report for another player.
2

2
The `for' string restricts the search to objects whose names begin with that string.
2
It is also possible to restrict the range of object numbers to include only those above a given number (`from') or below a given number (`to').
2

2
All forms of @audit print a report:
2

2
   #14 Gemba                          [The Pool]
2
  #144 Popgun                         [Gemba]
2
 #1479 Cockatoo                      *[The Living Room]
2
 #1673 Bottom of Swimming Pool       
2
 #2147 Cavern                        <-*west
2
 #2148 tunnel                         Bottom of Swimming ->Cavern
2

2
The first column is the object's number, the second its name. The third column shows the object's location: Gemba is in The Pool, and is carrying the Popgun (#144).
2
For exits, the third column shows source ->dest.
2
For rooms, the third column shows any entrances owned by someone else.
2
Object location, exit sources and destinations owned by another player are preceded by a *.
2

2
@audit uses a property .owned_objects on the player, for speed.  This property is updated at the time of each object creation and destruction and ownership change.  The verb @auditdb (same args as @audit) actually searches through the entire database for objects.
2

2
See also @verify-owned, @sort-owned, and @add-owned.
2

2
See also @prospectus, which gives some additional information.
36

5
2
Syntax:  @count [player]
2

2
Prints out the number of objects you or another person own.  Do not be surprised if this is one larger than you think it should be: remember that your player object is owned by you as well, even though you didn't create it in the usual way.
2

2
If byte-based quota is enabled, also prints the total usage by all objects at last measurement.

2
Syntax:  @create <class-name> named "<names>"
2
         @create <parent-object> named "<names>"
2

2
The main command for creating objects other than rooms and exits (for them, see 'help @dig'; it's much more convenient).
2

2
The first argument specifies the 'parent' of the new object: loosely speaking, the 'kind' of object you're creating.  <class-name> is one of the four standard classes of objects: $note, $letter, $thing, or $container.  As time goes on, more 'standard classes' may be added.  If the parent you have in mind for your new object isn't one of these, you may use the parent's name (if it's in the same room as you) or else its object number (e.g., #4562).
2

2
You may use "called" instead of "named" in this command, if you wish.
2

2
An object must be fertile to be used as a parent-class.  See help @chmod for details.
2

2
The <names> are given in the same format as in the @rename command:
2
        <name-and-alias>,<alias>,...,<alias> [preferred]
2
        <name>:<alias>,...,<alias> [not preferred]
2

2
See 'help @rename' for a discussion of the difference between a name and an alias.

2
The primary means for players to extend the MOO is for them to create new objects with interesting behavior.  There are convenient commands for creating and recycling objects and for keeping track of the objects you've created.  Help is available on these commands in the following topics:
2

2
@dig -- conveniently building new rooms and exits
2
@create -- making other kinds of objects
2
@recycle -- destroying objects you no longer want
2
@quota -- determining how many more objects you can build
2
@count -- determining how many objects you already own
2
@audit -- listing all of your objects
2
@classes -- listing all of the public classes available for your use
2
@move -- moving your objects from place to place
2
@parents, @kids -- examine the inheritance hierarchy.
36

4
24
2
Syntax:  @dig "<new-room-name>"
2
         @dig <exit-spec> to "<new-room-name>"
2
         @dig <exit-spec> to <old-room-object-number>
2

2
This is the basic building tool.  The first form of the command creates a new room with the given name.  The new room is not connected to anywhere else; it is floating in limbo.  The @dig command tells you its object number, though, so you can use the @move command to get there easily.
2

2
The second form of the command not only creates the room, but one or two exits linking your current location to (and possibly from) the new room.  An <exit-spec> has one of the following two forms:
2
        <names>
2
        <names>|<names>
2
where the first form is used when you only want to create one exit, from your current room to the new room, and the second form when you also want an exit back, from the new room to your current room.  In any case, the <names> piece is just a list of names for the exit, separated by commas; these are the names of the commands players can type to use the exit.  It is usually a good idea to include explicitly the standard abbreviations for direction names (e.g., 'n' for 'north', 'se' for 'southeast', etc.).  DO NOT put spaces in the names of exits; they are useless in MOO.
2

2
The third form of the command is just like the second form except that no new room is created; you instead specify by object number the other room to/from which the new exits will connect.

NOTE: You must own the room at one end or the other of the exits you create.  If you own both, everything is hunky-dorey.  If you own only one end, then after creating the exits you should write down their object numbers.  You must then get the owner of the other room to use @add-exit and @add-entrance to link your new exits to their room.
2

2
Examples:
2
    @dig "The Conservatory"
2
creates a new room named "The Conservatory" and prints out its object number.
2
    @dig north,n to "The North Pole"
2
creates a new room and also an exit linking the player's current location to the new room; players would say either 'north' or 'n' to get from here to the new room.  No way to get back from that room is created.
2
    @dig west,w|east,e,out to "The Department of Auto-Musicology"
2
creates a new room and two exits, one taking players from here to the new room (via the commands 'west' or 'w') and one taking them from the new room to here (via 'east', 'e', or 'out').
2
    @dig up,u to #7164
2
creates an exit leading from the player's current room to #7164, which must be an existing room.

Syntax:  @recycle <object-name-or-number>

There are a number of commands available to players for building new parts of the MOO.  Help on them is available under the following topics:
2

2
creation -- making, unmaking, and listing your rooms, exits, and other objects
2
topology -- making and listing the connections between rooms and exits
2
descriptions -- setting the names and descriptive texts for new objects
2
locking -- controlling use of and access to your objects
36

2
Syntax:  @dump <object> [with [id=#<id>] [noprops] [noverbs] [create]]
2

2
This spills out all the properties and verbs on an object, calling suspend at appropriate intervals.
2
   id=#<id> -- specifies an idnumber to use in place of the object's actual id (for porting to another MOO)
2
   noprops  -- don't show properties.
2
   noverbs  -- don't show verbs.
2
   create   -- indicates that a @create command should be generated and all of the verbs be introduced with @verb rather than @args; the default assumption is that the object already exists and you're just doing this to have a look at it.
2

2
Syntax:  @set <object>.<prop-name> to <value>
2

2
Changes the value of the specified object's property to the given value.
2
You must have permission to modify the property, either because you own the property or if it is writable.

Syntax:  @build-option
2
         @build-option <option>
2

2
Synonyms:  @buildoption, @builder-option @builderoption
2

2
The first form displays all of your builder options
2
The second displays just that one option, which may be one of the flags listed below.  The builder options control various annoying details of your building commands (e.g., @create, ...)
2

2
The remaining forms of this command are for setting your programmer options:
2

2
         @build-option create_flags [is] <flags>
2
         @build-option create_flags=<flags>
2
         @build-option -create_flags
2
                      (equivalent to create_flags="")
2

2
where flags is some substring of "rwf".  This option determines the read/write/fertility permissions of an object freshly created with @create or @recreate (see `help @create' and `help @recreate' and `help @chmod').  E.g., to make every object you create henceforth readable by default, do
2

2
         @build-option create_flags=r
2

2
For controlling the behavior of @dig, we have
2

2
         @build-option  dig_room=<room>
2
         @build-option  dig_room [is] <room>
2
         @build-option -dig_room
2
                      (equivalent to dig_room=$room)
2
         @build-option  dig_exit=<exit>
2
         @build-option  dig_exit [is] <exit>
2
         @build-option -dig_exit
2
                      (equivalent to dig_exit=$exit)
2

2
The following respectively set and reset the specified flag option
2

2
         @build-option +<option>
2
         @build-option -<option>
2
         @build-option !<option>           (equivalent to -<option>)
2

2
Currently the only builder flag option available is
2
 -bi_create     @create/@recycle re-use object numbers.
2
 +bi_create     @create/@recycle call create()/recycle() directly 
2

2
we prefer that you not use +bi_create, since this drives up the object numbers.

A few different messages can be set on a room object (see 'help messages' for instructions on doing so); they are printed to various audiences when a player or other object is ejected from the room.  (See 'help @eject'.)  The standard pronoun substitutions are made on each message before it is printed; see 'help pronouns' for details.
2

2
The default message is given in brackets after each name below:
2

2
@ejection  [%[$room.ejection_msg]]
2
  Printed to the player doing the ejecting.
2

2
@victim_ejection  [%[$room.victim_ejection_msg]]
2
  Printed to the object being ejected.
2

2
@oejection  [%[$room.oejection_msg]]
2
  Printed to others in the room from which the object is being ejected.

Syntax: @resident player
2
        @resident !player
2
        @resident
2

2
Adds or removes a player from the residents list of a room.  The residents list controls who is allowed to use @sethome in that room.  This defaults to just the owner of the room; by manipulating the residents list you may allow additional players to use that room as their home.
2

2
@resident player adds that player to the list.  
2
@resident !player removes that player from the list.
2
@resident with no arguments simply displays the current list (which may be "none", indicating no additional people besides the owner may use that room as their home).
2

2
See also help @sethome.
2

2
Hints for programmers: The verb $room:accept_for_abode is called by @sethome.  By overriding this verb you can give different criteria to @sethome.  It should return 1 for allowed and 0 for denied.

Several kinds of messages can be set on an exit object (see 'help messages' for instructions on doing so); they are printed to various audiences at certain times whenever an attempt is made to go through the exit.  The ones whose names begin with 'o' are always shown prefixed with the name of the player making the attempt and a single space character.  The standard pronoun substitutions (with respect to the player) are made on each message before it is printed; see 'help pronouns' for details.
2

2
The default message is given in brackets after each name below:
2

2
@leave  [%[$exit.leave_msg]]
2
  Printed to the player just before they successfully use the exit.
2

2
@oleave  [%[$exit.oleave_msg||"has left."]]
2
  Printed to others in the source room when a player successfully uses the exit.
2

2
@arrive  [%[$exit.arrive_msg]]
2
  Printed to the player just after they successfully use the exit.
2

2
@oarrive  [%[$exit.oarrive_msg||"has arrived."]]
2
  Printed to others in the destination room when a player successfully uses the exit.
2

2
@nogo  [%[$exit.nogo_msg||"You can't go that way."]]
2
  Printed to the player when they fail in using the exit.

Syntax:  @add-entrance <exit-object-number>
2

2
Add the exit with the given object number as a recognized entrance to the current room (that is, one whose use is not considered teleportation).  Usually, @dig does this for you, but it doesn't if you don't own the room in question.  Instead, it tells you the object number of the new exit and you have to find the owner of the room and get them to use the @add-entrance command to link it up.

2
Syntax:  @add-exit <exit-object-number>

2
Add the exit with the given object number as a conventional exit from the current room (that is, an exit that can be invoked simply by typing its name, like 'east').  Usually, @dig does this for you, but it doesn't if you don't own the room in question.  Instead, it tells you the object number of the new exit and you have to find the owner of the room and get them to use the @add-exit command to link it up.

The topology of the MOO universe is determined by the rooms that exist and the exits that connect them.  Several commands are available for creating and discovering the topology of the MOO.  Help on them is available under the following topics:
2

2
@dig -- creating new rooms and exits
2
@add-exit -- adding other players' exits from your rooms
2
@add-entrance -- adding other player's entrances to your rooms
2
@remove-exit -- removing exits from your room
2
@remove-entrance -- removing entrances from your room
2
@exits -- listing all of the conventional exits from your rooms
2
@entrances -- listing all of the conventional entrances to your rooms
2
@resident -- listing or changing the residents of your rooms
36

Containers are objects that allow you to store other objects inside them.  The following help topics cover verbs that can be used with containers:
2

2
put -- putting an object into a container
2
remove -- taking an object out of a container
2

2
Containers may be open or closed, using the verbs 'open container' and 'close container'.  Containers have a separate lock to determine if a player may open them.  See the following help topics:
2

2
@lock_for_open -- setting the lock for opening a container
2
@unlock_for_open -- clearing the lock
2

2
You can make a container by creating a child of the standard container, $container (see 'help @create').
2

2
Containers have a large number of messages which get printed when players act upon them.  See 'help container-messages' for more information.
2

2
Containers have opacity.  See 'help @opacity' for more information.

2
   1:  The container is opaque, and you cannot see into it when closed
2
   2:  The container is a black hole, and you can never see into it whether closed or open.

Several kinds of messages can be set on 'things', objects that have $thing as an ancestor (see 'help messages' for instructions on doing so).  They are printed to various audiences under various circumstances when an attempt is made to 'take' or 'drop' a thing.  The ones whose names begin with 'o' are always shown prefixed with the name of the player making the attempt and a single space character.  The standard pronoun substitutions (with respect to the player) are made on each message before it is printed; see 'help pronouns' for details.

Syntax:  @quota
2

2
Each player has a limit as to how many objects that player may create, called their 'quota'.  Every object they create lowers the quota by one and every object they recycle increases it by one.  If the quota goes to zero, then that player may not create any more objects (unless, of course, they recycle some first).
2

2
The @quota command prints out your current quota.
2

2
The quota mechanism is intended to solve a long-standing problem in many MUDs: database bloat.  The problem is that a large number of people build a large number of dull objects and areas that are subsequently never used or visited.  The database becomes quite large and difficult to manage without getting substantially more interesting.  With the quota system, we can make it possible for players to experiment and learn while simultaneously keeping random building to acceptable levels.

To get a larger quota, talk to a wizard.  They will take a look at what you've done with the objects you've built so far and make a determination about whether or not it would be a net gain for the MOO community if you were to build some more things.  If so, they will increase your quota; if not, they will try to explain some ways in which you could build things that were more useful, entertaining, or otherwise interesting to other players.  Wizards may be more impressed by objects which are interactive and employ a fair number of verbs.

Syntax:

  @measure object <object name>
2
  @measure summary [player]
2
  @measure new [player]
2
  @measure breakdown <object name>
2
  @measure recent [number of days] [player]
2

2
When the MOO is under byte-quota, objects in the MOO are measured approximately once a week, and the usage tally as reported by @quota is updated.  You may wish to measure an object specially, however, without waiting for the automatic measurement to take place, or if the MOO is under object-quota.  @measure has some subcommands to handle this.
2

2
@measure object will measure an individual object right now, update the usage of that object in your usage as reported by @quota, and update the date of that object's measurement.
2

2
@measure summary will go through your or another player's objects and produce the summary information that is printed by @quota.  Normally this will be just the same as @quota prints out, but occasionally the addition/subtraction done to keep @quota in sync will get out of date, and @measure summary will be needed.
2

2
@measure new will go through all your or another player's objects, measuring exactly those which have never been measured before (that is, are too newly @created to have any measurement data).  This is necessary as any player is only permitted to own 10 unmeasured objects, or object creation will not be permitted.
2

2
@measure breakdown will give you full information on where an object's size is coming from.  It will offer to moomail you the result.  Caution: don't forget to delete this message, as it is large and takes up a lot of space!
2

2
@measure recent will let you re-measure objects of yours or another player's which have not been measured in the specified number of days (the default is the ordinary cycle of the measurement task).

2
For "sticky", `mail command' is one of @mail, @read, @prev, @next, @answer.
2
All flags default to the `-' settings.  
2

2
Next, we have
2

2
         @mail-option  manymsgs [is] <number>
2
         @mail-option  manymsgs=<number>
2
         @mail-option -manymsgs
2

2
The first two forms specify that if you give a @mail or @read command asking for <number> or more messages, you will first be given a yes-or-no prompt to continue, the idea being that you many not actually have wanted to see that many messages.  The third form turns off this behavior.
2

2
         @mail-option  @mail [is] <message-sequence>
2

2
The "@mail" option determines what message-sequence the @mail command uses by 
2
default.  Initially, this is "last:15", but other reasonable choices include
2
"new" and "1-last"
2

2
         @mail-option  replyto [is] <recipient> [<recipient>...]
2
         @mail-option -replyto
2

2
The first form specifies that a Reply-To: field is to be placed in all messages constructed by @send or @answer.  Note this can still be changed before sending via the mail room's reply-to command.  
2
The second form resets this option so that no Reply-to: is initially inserted.
2

2
        @mail-option rn_order=<order>
2

2
controls the order in which folders listed by @rn and @subscribed will appear.  <order> can be one of
2

2
 read    folders are sorted by last read date. (default)
2
 send    folders are sorted by last send date.
2
 fixed   folders are not sorted
2

2
To control expiration of messages (see `help @keep-mail') we have
2

2
        @mail-option expire [is] <time-interval>
2
        @mail-option expire=<time-interval>
2

2
<time-interval> can either be a number of seconds or something with units in it, e.g.,
2

2
        @mail-option expire 13 days
2
        @mail-option expire 1 year 39 days
2

2
A negative number or
2

2
        @mail-option +expire
2

2
disables message expiration entirely
2

2
        @mail-option -expire
2

2
sets your message expiration time to the current default.
2

2
        @mail-option @unsend=<message sequence>
2

2
sets the default message sequence that the @unsend command will operate upon.  The default is "last:1".

2
There are 3 personal properties that you can use to customize how your mail is composed and forwarded
2

2
.mail_forward 
2
 -- list of objects that will receive any mail that gets sent to you.
2
    Objects on this list should either be players or descendants of 
2
    $mail_recipient.
2
    If this list is nonempty, you will not receive any mail yourself unless
2
    you are on it.  E.g., if Rog is #4292 and ur-Rog is #6349
2

2
  #6349.mail_forward={}            -- usual case; ur-Rog gets his own mail.
2
  #6349.mail_forward={#4292}       -- Rog gets ur-Rog's mail instead.
2
  #6349.mail_forward={#6349,#4292} -- ur-Rog gets mail and Rog gets a copy.
2
  #6349.mail_forward={#-1}         -- ur-Rog's mail disappears without a trace.
2

2
.mail_notify
2
 -- list of objects to be notified whenever mail is sent to you.
2
    This list may include anything that has a :notify_mail() verb.
2
    Notification will take place regardless of whether or how your mail
2
    is forwarded.  
2

2
Thus, in the previous example
2

2
  #4292.mail_notify={#6349} --- means that ur-Rog will be told
2
                                whenever Rog is sent new mail.
2

2
.mail_options
2
 -- this controls lots of miscellaneous things.  Use the @mail-option command
2
    to view and set these options (see `help @mail-option')
2

2
See `help mail-resolve' for more detail on how mail forwarding and mail notification work.  See `help MR-subscribing' for information on how to change .mail_forward and .mail_notify on $mail_recipient children, where they are !c properties.

2
Syntax:  @forward <msg> [on *<collection>] to <recipient> [<recipient>...]
2
Syntax:  @resend  <msg> [on *<collection>] to <recipient> [<recipient>...]
2

2
Both of these commands take the indicated message in your (or some other) message collection, and sends it on to the indicated recipients in some form.
2

2
@forward sends an entirely new message whose body is the original message (both headers and body).
2
@resend sends the original message, but with a header containing the lines
2

2
  From:  original-sender
2
  To:    original-recipients...
2
  Resent-By: you
2
  Resent-To: new-recipients...
2

2
If you prefer to have yourself in the From: line of messages you @resend, set the mail option `resend_forw (see `help @mail-options').  In this case, the message will instead have a header containing the lines
2

2
  From:  you
2
  To:    new-recipients...
2
  Original-From:  original-sender
36

22
2
Syntax:  @subscribe *<collection> [with|without notification] [before|after *<collection>]
2
         @subscribe
2
         @subscribe-quick
2

2
The second and third form of the command gives a list of all mail collections that are readable by you. The third form omits the mail collection description.
2

2
The first form of this command sets up a current message and a last-read-time for the given mail collection so that when you next log in or issue the @rn command, you will be informed about new mail that has appeared there.  Note that this happens automatically whenever you @read messages on a given collection, so if this much is all you care about, you don't need to use this command; just do, e.g.,
2
         @read last on *<collection>
2

2
Specifying "with notification" causes you to be added to the immediate-notification list (.mail_notify) for that collection, i.e., whenever new mail arrives there, you will be notified immediately.  Specifying "without notification" causes you to be removed from the collection's .mail_notify.
2

2
Specifying "before *<other-collection>" causes <collection> to be placed immediately before *<collection> in your @rn listing (which see) and likewise for the "after" clause.  By default, new collections are placed at the end of your list.  The before/after specification is only useful if you have @mail-option rn_order=fixed set (see `help @mail-options').
2

2
@subscribing to a collection for which you already have a current-message/last-read-time has no effect other from possibly changing that collection's .mail_notify and/or reordering your collections for @rn.
2

2
You can only @subscribe to collections that are readable by you.
2

2
Note that this is entirely different from the Mail Room `subscribe' command
2
which actually adds you to the .mail_forward list for a given collection/
2
mailing-list, so that mail sent to the list actually shows up in your own
2
mail collection.
2
We're probably going to phase out the Mail Room `subscribe' command...

2
Syntax:  @rn
2

2
For each collection of mail messages that you read other from your own, a last-read-time is kept.  This command tells you which collections (out of all those you have ever read) have recently had messages added to them, i.e., more recently than when you last did a @read, @prev, @next, or @skip on that collection.
2

2
Etymologists' note:  If you thought @rn had anything to do with the popular UNIX newsreading program `rn', it's just your imagination.

2
Syntax:  @skip [<collection>...]
2
         @unsubscribe [<collection>...]
2

2
For each collection of mail messages that you read other from your own, a current message and a last-read-time is kept.  Normally, if you neglect to actually @read any messages on a collection other from your own, @rn (or :check_mail_lists) will continue to remind you that they are there.
2

2
The @skip command indicates that you're not interested in reading the rest of the messages that currently exist in that given collection.  
2

2
The @unsubscribe command flushes the current-message/last-read-time information completely, indicating that you are not only uninterested in the rest of the messages on that collection, but also likewise uninterested in anything else that may appear on that collection later on.  @unsubscribe also removes you from the collection's .mail_notify list.

2
Certain mail commands, including @mail, @read, and @rmmail, allow a <message-sequence> argument that indicates to which messages in one's collection the command is to apply.  Any combination of the following may appear as a <message-sequence> argument to any of the various mail commands (@mail, @read, @answer, @rmm).
2

2
  17        message number 17 if there is one (and likewise for other integers)
2
  17..23    all messages numbered between 17 and 23 (inclusive), if any.
2
  cur       the current message
2
  prev      the message before
2
  next      the message after
2
  prev17    the 17 messages prior to the current message
2
  next17    the 17 messages after the current message
2
  first     the first message if any
2
  last      the final message if any (`$' is a synonym for `last')
2
  new       unread messages if any
2

2
You may use as many of these at once as sanity permits, e.g.,
2

2
  @mail cur 1..5 last
2

2
which will display the header for your current message, your messages in the range 1..5, and your last message.  Though some of these ranges may overlap, the header for any given message is only shown once in any event.
2

2
In addition, there are other message-sequence arguments that act as filters on whatever precedes them. 
2

2
 before:<date>               messages strictly before the given date
2
 after:<date>                messages strictly after the given date
2
 since:<date>                messages on or after the given date
2
 until:<date>                messages on or before the given date
2
 from:<player>[|<player...]  messages from the given player(s)
2
 to:<recip>[|<recip>...]     messages to the given recipient(s)
2
 %from:<string>              messages with <string> in the From: line
2
 %to:<string>                messages with <string> in the To: line
2
 subject:<string>            messages with <string> in the subject
2
 body:<string>               messages with <string> in the body (SLOW!!!)
2
 first:<number>              the first <number> messages
2
 last:<number>               the last <number> messages
2
 kept:                       messages marked as kept (see `help @keep-mail')
2
 unkept:                     messages not marked as kept
2

2
<date>  is either a weekday, "today", "yesterday", or
2
        a dd-Month, dd-Month-yy or dd-Month-yyyy date
2
<recip> is either <player> or *<$mail_recipient kid>
2

Examples:
2

2
  @read from:G7|Gemba              read all messages from G7 or Gemba
2
  @rmm to:yduJ|*Core               remove messages that are to yduJ or to *Core
2
  @mail since:1-Jan before:1-Feb   show messages dated in January
2
  @mail since:Tues                 show messages dated on or after Tuesday
2
  @rmm subject:manners             remove msgs with `manners' in the subject:
2
  @mail subject:"stupid idiots"    (search string contains a space => need "'s)
2
  @rmm to:yduJ to:*Core            remove messages that are to yduJ and *Core
2
  @mail from:Haakon last:5         show the last 5 messages from Haakon
2
  @mail %from:guest                show mail from players with "guest" in
2
                                   their names
2
  @mail last:10 body:fribble       show those of the last 10 messages having
2
                                   `fribble' in the body (one should always try
2
                                   to narrow body searches in this way).

2
Syntax:  @unrmmail [list|expunge] [on *<collection>]
2

2
When you do @rmmail on a particular message collection, the messages removed don't go away immediately, but are rather saved elsewhere.  These "zombie" messages can be brought back or examined using the @UNrmmail command.
2

2
Without `list' or `expunge', @unrmm restores the zombie messages, thus undoing the effect of the most recent @rmmail command.  Only the most recent @rmmail can be undone in this way; messages deleted by any previous @rmmail commands on this same collection are lost and gone forever.
2

2
The `list' option merely lists the headers of the zombie messages without actually restoring them.
2

2
The `expunge' option banishes the zombie messages forever.
2

2
Note that the message numbers used by zombie messages are held in reserve against the possibility that you might @unrmm them some day; with such messages around, new messages received will be given higher numbers than you might have expected.  @renumber does an implicit @unrmm expunge.
2

2
`@unrmmail' and `@unrmmail expunge' on collections other than your own are only allowed when you have write access.  Likewise, `@unrmmail list' on other collections is only possible when they are readable by you.

2
Syntax:  @renumber [<collection>]
2

2
Renumbers the messages in your collection to go from 1 to however many you have at the moment.  The optional argument allows you to renumber the messages stored in some other collection (@renumber, like @rmmail, requires write access).
2

2
Note that if you have zombie messages from a previous @rmmail command (see `help zombie-messages'), these will be expunged.
36
5
4
3
2
Syntax:  @prev [<number>] [on <collection>]
2

2
Print the 'previous' message in a given email collection (defaults to your own).  The mail system's notion of your 'current message' for that collection is decremented.  Thus, e.g., one can review all of one's previous messages one-by-one simply by typing '@prev' repeatedly.  If <number> is supplied, print (and decrement current message by) that many messages.
36
5
4
3
2
Syntax:  @next [<number>] [on <collection>]
2

2
Print the `next' message in a given email collection (defaults to your own).  The mail system's notion of your 'current message' for that collection is incremented.  Thus, e.g., one can read all of one's new messages one-by-one simply by typing '@next' repeatedly.  If <number> is supplied, prints and advances that many messages.

17
2
Syntax:  @answer [<message-number>] [sender] [all] [include] [noinclude] [followup]
2

2
Synonym: @reply
2

2
Prepares for you to compose a MOO email message to the players who either received or composed the indicated message from your collection.  The usual editor is invoked (see `help editors' for details).  The subject line for the new message will be initialized from that of the indicated message.  If you leave off the message number, the reply will be to your current message, if that exists.  In fact you may give a general message-sequence (see `help message-sequences') argument here, provided that it indicates only a single message (e.g., `@answer last:1')
2

2
If there is a Reply-to: field in the message you are @answer'ing, its contents will be used to initialize the To: line of your reply.  Otherwise, a To: line is determined depending on whether you specified `sender', `all', or `followup' in the command line (or your .mail_options).
2
  `sender'   replies to sender only
2
  `all'      replies to sender and all original recipients
2
  `followup' replies to first original recipient that is a non-player
2
             (no effect if there are no non-player recipients).
2

2
`include' includes the text of the original message in your reply, `noinclude' does not.  
2

2
`sender', `all', `followup', `include', and `noinclude' can all be abbreviated (e.g., `@answer i').
2

2
Defaults are `sender' and `noinclude', but you can change this by setting your .mail-options (see `help mail-options').  
36

12
2
Syntax:  @rmmail [<message-sequence>] [from *<recipient>]
2

2
Deletes the indicated messages from your MOO email collection.
2
By default, your current message is deleted.
2
See `help message-sequence' for the full list of possible arguments.
2
You get the message numbers for use here by typing the '@mail' command.
2

2
There is no confirmation for this action, so be careful.  While it is true that @unrmmail will be able to bring back the messages deleted by the last @rmm, any messages deleted before then are really gone, i.e., irrecoverable.  See `help @unrmmail' for more information.
2

2
This command may be used on other mail recipients (children of $mail_recipient), but only ones to which you have write access (you either have to own it or be on good terms with whoever does...).
2

2
You can try to delete messages that you accidentally sent to a person with the command @unsend (see `help @unsend').  Note there are restrictions on the operation, so it often will not work.

14
2
Syntax:  @read <message-number>
2
         @read
2
         @peek ...
2

2
Prints the contents of the indiciated messages from your MOO email collection.  You get the message numbers for use here by typing the '@mail' command, which prints a table of contents for your entire MOO email collection.  If no arguments are given to @read, then the 'current message' in your collection is printed.  In any case, the 'current message' after @read finishes is the last one printed.
2

2
The most general form of the @read command is
2

2
         @read <message-sequence> [on *<collection>]  
2

2
where <message-sequence> is as described in `help message-sequences'.
2
As with the @mail command you may @read messages on any publically readable collection (child of $mail_recipient).
2

2
The @peek command is a variant of @read that works no differently except that it refrains from setting your `current message'.  This is useful, for example, if you want to see some particular message on a collection without losing track of where you are in it.
36

10
2
Syntax:  @send <recipient> [<recipient> ...]  [subj[ect]="<subject>"]
2

2
Prepares for you to compose a MOO email message to the recipients named on the command line.  A recipient can be specified by giving a player name or object-id, or a '*' followed by the name or object-id of some non-player mail recipient (e.g., a mailing list or a mail folder) -- a list of such non-player recipients is available from within the mailroom with the 'showlists' command.
2

2
The usual editor is invoked.   
2
You will be prompted for a subject line if you did not specify one in the @send command (see `help mail_options' for how to avoid this).
2
Use `say' (") to insert lines in the body of your message.  
2
See `help editors' for details.
2

2
Giving this command without arguments resumes editing the previous unsent draft message if one exists.

2
The MOO email system allows you to send and receive messages to and from other players.  It provides commands to view and manage your own collection of saved messages and, in addition, to browse through other collections that may be available (e.g.,archives of public mailing lists).  Help is available on the following commands:
2

2
@mail     -- seeing a table of contents for a collection of email messages
2
@read     -- reading individual messages 
2
@next     -- reading the 'next'     message
2
@prev     -- reading the 'previous' message
2

2
@send     -- composing and sending a message to other players
2
@answer   -- replying to one of the messages in a collection
2
@forward  -- resending one of the messages in a collection somewhere else
2

2
@rmmail   -- discarding some subset of a collection
2
@unrmmail -- undoing the most recent @rmm on a collection
2
@unsend   -- try to remove a message you accidentally sent
2
@renumber -- renumbering the messages in a collection
2
@keep-mail - marking messages in a collection as exempt from expiration
2

2
@mail-option -- describes and sets various customization flags
2

2
help mail-forwarding
2
 -- describes mail forwarding
2
help message-sequences
2
 -- describes message-sequences arguments to @mail, @read, @rmm, and @answer.
2

2
For viewing collections other from your own, the following commands are useful:
2

2
@rn          -- list those collections that have new messages on them
2
@subscribe   -- indicate that you want @rn to report on a given collection
2
                  and add yourself to its .mail_notify list
2
@skip        -- ignore any remaining new messages in a given collection
2
@unsubscribe -- ignore a given collection entirely from now on
2
                  and remove yourself from its .mail_notify list
2
@unsubscribed-- show the mailing lists that you aren't subscribed to.
2
@subscribed  -- like @rn, but shows all lists that you are subscribed to

                even if they have no new activity

         @mail 1-$            (to see *all* messages)
2

2
Shows a table of contents for your MOO email message collection.  You are notified when you connect to the MOO if there are any such messages.  A little arrow indicates the mail system's notion of your 'current message'.  
2
The first form lists all of your messages or the last 15 if you have more than that many; the second form lists only those messages after your `current message'.  The third form shows your entire collection.
2

2
If you have a large number of mail messages, you can give arguments so that @mail only lists the messages you're interested in.  You can also list messages residing on mail recipients which are public or for which you have read access.
2
The general format is
2

2
         @mail <message-sequence> [on *<recipient>]
2

2
<recipient> must name some child of $mail_recipient (e.g., a mailing list);
2
<message-sequence> can be a sequence of message numbers; you can also scan the recipient for articles that fit a given description, as specified in `help message-sequences'.
2

2
Note that if you view mail on some other recipient and have "sticky" in your .mail_options (see `help mail-options'), all further mail commands (e.g., @read, @next, @rmm,...) will apply to that recipient.  In this case use `@mail on me' to go back to looking at your own mail.

Syntax:  @netforward <message-number>
2
         @netforward 
2
         @netforward <message-sequence> on *collection
2

2
Forwards the contents of the indiciated messages from your MOO email collection to your registered email address.  You get the message numbers for use here by typing the '@mail' command, which prints a table of contents for your entire MOO email collection.  If no arguments are given to @netforward, then the 'current message' in your collection is sent.  In any case, the 'current message' after @netforward finishes is not affected.
2

2
The most general form of the @netforward command is
2

2
         @netforward <message-sequence> [on *<collection>]
2

2
where <message-sequence> is as described in `help message-sequences'.
2
As with the @mail command you may @netforward messages on any publically readable collection (child of $mail_recipient).
2

2
Before messages are sent, you are asked to confirm the email unless you have set your `expert_netfwd' mail option on.  See `help @mail-options' for details.
2

2
If you do not have a valid registered email address, you will not be able to use this command and must first @registerme or get a wizard to register your address. `help @registerme' for details.

2
Syntax:  @keep-mail [<message-sequence>]
2
         @keep-mail none
2

2
Synonym: @keepmail
2

2
As a space-saving measure, there is a task that runs periodically and from all player collections removes those messages that are
2
  (1) marked as read (i.e., dated before the last-read-date), 
2
  (2) older than a certain expire time, and
2
  (3) not specifically marked as "kept".
2

2
"kept" messages will show up in your @mail listing with an `=' to the right of the message number.
2

2
The first form of the @keep-mail command marks the indicated messages as kept.  The message-sequence argument is as with other mail commands (see `help message-sequences').  @keep-mail without any arguments marks your current message as kept.
2

2
The second form of the command is used to remove all such marks from your mail collection.
2

2
    @mail kept:
2

2
will produce a list of all messages marked as kept (see `help message-sequences').
2

2
You can use @mail-option expire (see `help @mail-option') to change your expire time.
2

2
You can use the @netforward command (see `help @netforward') to send mail to your email address for local archival.
2

2
[...At the time of this writing, player mail is taking up a large fraction of LambdaMOO's database.  It would be appreciated if you not @keep any more mail than you have to...]

2

2
Synonym:  @qreply
2

2
The @quickreply command allows you to do a short reply to a mail message without heading for the mail room.  As with @reply, the subject line on the reply message is taken from the original.  <flags> are as with @reply, except that `include' is not recognized --- if you're going to include the original message, you *have* to trim it down, and that requires the editor.

Alternative mail reading commands.
2

2
Syntax:  @nn
2

2
This command finds a folder containing an unread message, displays the first such, and updates your last-read-time for that folder.  Your personal mail and all @subscribed folders are checked.
2

2
Syntax:  @mail-all-new-mail
2

2
Displays headers of all unread messages on all of your folders (i.e., your personal folder and all @subscribed folders).
2

2
Syntax:  @read-all-new-mail
2

2
Displays all unread messages on all of your folders (i.e., your personal folder and all @subscribed folders).  This command ends with a prompt, "Did you get all of that? [Enter `yes' or `no']."  Answering "yes" causes all of your last-read times to be updated.  You will probably want to check for <<<n lines flushed>>> indications before you answer this question.
2

2
@read-all-new-mail (with a "yes" answer at the end) is equivalent to doing a large number of @nn's.

         @copymail <message-seq> [on mail-recipient] to mail-recipient
2

2
Moves a message sequence directly from one mail recipient (defaulting as per the sticky @mail-option) to another, without adding headers or reordering.
2

2
NOTE:  The recipient of @refiled messages may well have its mail out of order.  This can confuse a variety of features of the mail system, which expects its messages to always be in chronological order.  Care should be exercised with @refile/@copymail.

2
Usage:  @add-notify player to me
2
    Makes sure that player wants to be notified, if so, adds them to my .mail_notify property.
2

2
In order for one person to be notified that another person has new mail, both the mail recipient and the notification recipient should agree that this is an OK transfer of information.  This verb facilitates that transaction.

The @unsend command was created by ballot on LambdaMOO, *B:Unsend (#77081).
2

2
Syntax: @unsend [message-sequence] from <user>
2

2
A message cannot be unsent to a player if e has read the message, it has been forwarded to eir e-mail address, or e has set an option to prevent messages being unsent to em.  A message cannot be unsent to a group of players unless it can be unsent to each player in the group.
2

2
The unsender may not view a list of unread messages on a player.  E may only select the message(s) to be unsent by filters such as "subject:<subject>" or "since:today".
2

2
In order to protect privacy, if any of the restrictions above, such as one of the users having already read the message, are not met, the error message will be quite generic and not tell you exactly what went wrong, but simply that messages could not be unsent.
2

2
The following mail options are available:
2

2
@mail-option +no_unsend      No one may @unsend messages they sent to you
2
@mail-option -no_unsend      People may @unsend unread messages they send to you
2
@mail-option @unsend=<message sequence>
2

2
sets the default message sequence that the @unsend command will operate upon.  The default is "last:1".

Syntax:  string_hmac (STR text, STR key [, STR algo [, binary]])
2
         binary_hmac (STR bin-string, STR key [, STR algo [, binary]])
2

2
Returns a string encoding the result of applying the HMAC-SHA256 cryptographically secure HMAC function to the contents of the string text or the binary string bin-string with the specified secret key. If algo is provided, it specifies the hashing algorithm to use. Currently, only "SHA1" and "SHA256" are supported. If binary is provided and true, the result is in MOO binary string format; by default the result is a hexidecimal string.
2

2
All cryptographically secure HMACs have the property that, if string_hmac(x, a) == string_hmac(y, b) then, almost certainly, equal(x, y) and furthermore, equal(a, b)
2

2
 This can be useful, for example, in applications that need to verify both the integrity of the message (the text) and the authenticity of the sender (as demonstrated by the possession of the secret key).

2

2

Syntax: exec (LIST command[, STR input][, LIST environment variables])
2

2
Asynchronously executes the specified external executable, optionally sending input. Returns the process return code, output and error. If the programmer is not a wizard, then E_PERM is raised.
2

2
The first argument must be a list of strings, or E_INVARG is raised. The first string is the path to the executable and is required. The rest are command line arguments passed to the executable.
2

2
The path to the executable may not start with a slash (/) or dot-dot (..), and it may not contain slash-dot (/.) or dot-slash (./), or E_INVARG is raised. If the specified executable does not exist or is not a regular file, E_INVARG is raised.
2

2
If the string input is present, it is written to standard input of the executing process.
2

2
Additionally, you can provide a list of environment variables to set in the shell.
2

2
When the process exits, it returns a list of the form:
2

2
{code, output, error}
2

2
code is the integer process exit status or return code. output and error are strings of data that were written to the standard output and error of the process.
2

2
The specified command is executed asynchronously. The function suspends the current task and allows other tasks to run until the command finishes. Tasks suspended this way can be killed with kill_task().
2

2
The strings, input, output and error are all MOO binary strings.
2

2
All external executables must reside in the executables directory.

Syntax: generate_json (ANY value [, STR mode])
2

2
Returns the JSON representation of the MOO value.
2

2
MOO supports a richer set of values than JSON allows. The optional mode specifies how this function handles the conversion of MOO values into their JSON representation.
2

2
The common subset mode, specified by the literal mode string "common-subset", is the default conversion mode. In this mode, only the common subset of types (strings and numbers) are translated with fidelity between MOO types and JSON types. All other types are treated as alternative representations of the string type. This mode is useful for integration with non-MOO applications.
2

2
The embedded types mode, specified by the literal mode string "embedded-types", adds type information. Specifically, values other than strings and numbers, which carry implicit type information, are converted into strings with type information appended. The converted string consists of the string representation of the value (as if tostr() were applied) followed by the pipe (|) character and the type. This mode is useful for serializing/deserializing objects and collections of MOO values.

parse_json("{\"foo\":1.1}", "embedded-types")               =>   ["foo" -> 1.1]
2
parse_json("{\"foo\":\"#1\"}")                              =>   ["foo" -> "#1"]
2
parse_json("{\"foo\":\"#1\"}", "common-subset")             =>   ["foo" -> "#1"]
2
parse_json("{\"foo\":\"#1|obj\"}", "embedded-types")        =>   ["foo" -> #1]
2
parse_json("{\"foo\":\"E_PERM\"}")                          =>   ["foo" -> "E_PERM"]
2
parse_json("{\"foo\":\"E_PERM\"}", "common-subset")         =>   ["foo" -> "E_PERM"]
2
parse_json("{\"foo\":\"E_PERM|err\"}", "embedded-types")    =>   ["foo" -> E_PERM]
2

2
In embedded types mode, key values can be converted to MOO types by appending type information. The full set of supported types are obj, str, err, float and int.
2

2
parse_json("{\"1\":2}")                                     =>   ["1" -> 2]
2
parse_json("{\"1\":2}", "common-subset")                    =>   ["1" -> 2]
2
parse_json("{\"1|int\":2}", "embedded-types")               =>   [1 -> 2]
2
parse_json("{\"#1|obj\":2}", "embedded-types")              =>   [#1 -> 2]
2

2
JSON defines types that MOO (currently) does not support, such as boolean true and false, and null. These values are always converted to the strings "true", "false" and "null".

Syntax: random_bytes (INT count)
2

2
Returns a binary string composed of between one and 10000 random bytes. count specifies the number of bytes and must be a positive integer; otherwise, E_INVARG is raised. 
36

2
Syntax: read_http (request-or-response [, OBJ conn])
2

2
Reads lines from the connection conn (or, if not provided, from the player that typed the command that initiated the current task) and attempts to parse the lines as if they are an HTTP request or response. request-or-response must be either the string "request" or "response". It dictates the type of parsing that will be done.
2

2
Just like read(), if conn is provided, then the programmer must either be a wizard or the owner of conn; if conn is not provided, then read_http() may only be called by a wizard and only in the task that was last spawned by a command from the connection in question. Otherwise, E_PERM is raised. Likewise, if conn is not currently connected and has no pending lines of input, or if the connection is closed while a task is waiting for input but before any lines of input are received, then read_http() raises E_INVARG.
2

2
If parsing fails because the request or response is syntactically incorrect, read_http() will return a map with the single key "error" and a list of values describing the reason for the error. If parsing succeeds, read_http() will return a map with an appropriate subset of the following keys, with values parsed from the HTTP request or response: "method", "uri", "headers", "body", "status" and "upgrade".
2

2
    Fine point: read_http() assumes the input strings are binary strings. When called interactively, as in the example below, the programmer must insert the literal line terminators or parsing will fail. 
2

2
The following example interactively reads an HTTP request from the players connection.
2

2
read_http("request", player)
2
GET /path HTTP/1.1~0D~0A
2
Host: example.com~0D~0A
2
~0D~0A
2

2
In this example, the string ~0D~0A ends the request. The call returns the following (the request has no body):
2

2
["headers" -> ["Host" -> "example.com"], "method" -> "GET", "uri" -> "/path"]
2

2
The following example interactively reads an HTTP response from the players connection.
2

2
read_http("response", player)
2
HTTP/1.1 200 Ok~0D~0A
2
Content-Length: 10~0D~0A
2
~0D~0A
2
1234567890
2

2
The call returns the following:
2

2
["body" -> "1234567890", "headers" -> ["Content-Length" -> "10"], "status" -> 200]

Syntax: salt (STR format, STR input)
2

2
Generate a crypt() compatible salt string for the specified salt format using the specified binary random input. The specific set of formats supported depends on the libraries used to build the server, but will always include the standard salt format, indicated by the format string "" (the empty string), and the BCrypt salt format, indicated by the format string "$2a$NN$" (where "NN" is the work factor). Other possible formats include MD5 ("$1$"), SHA256 ("$5$") and SHA512 ("$6$"). Both the SHA256 and SHA512 formats support optional rounds.
2

Syntax: strtr (STR source, STR str1, STR str2 [, case-matters])
2

2
Transforms the string source by replacing the characters specified by str1 with the corresponding characters specified by str2. All other characters are not transformed. If str2 has fewer characters than str1 the unmatched characters are simply removed from source. By default the transformation is done on both upper and lower case characters no matter the case. If case-matters is provided and true, then case is treated as significant.

2
strtr("foobar", "o", "i")           =>    "fiibar"

Syntax: crypt (STR text [, STR salt])
2

2
Encrypts (hashes) the given text using the standard UNIX encryption method. If provided, salt should be a string at least two characters long, and it may dictate a specific algorithm to use. By default, crypt uses the original, now insecure, DES algorithm. Stunt specifically includes the BCrypt algorithm (identified by salts that start with "$2a$"), and may include MD5, SHA256, and SHA512 algorithms depending on the libraries used to build the server. The salt used is returned as the first part of the resulting encrypted string.
2

2
Aside from the possibly-random input in the salt, the encryption algorithms are entirely deterministic. In particular, you can test whether or not a given string is the same as the one used to produce a given piece of encrypted text; simply extract the salt from the front of the encrypted text and pass the candidate string and the salt to crypt(). If the result is identical to the given encrypted text, then youve got a match.

2

2
Note: The specific set of supported algorithms depends on the libraries used to build the server. Only the BCrypt algorithm, which is distributed with the server source code, is guaranteed to exist. BCrypt is currently mature and well tested, and is recommended for new development.

Syntax:   argon2 (STR <password>, STR <salt> [, <iterations> 3] [, <memory usage in KB> 4096] [, <CPU threads> 1]) => STR
2

2
The function `argon2()' hashes a password using the Argon2id password hashing algorithm. It is parametrized by three optional arguments:
2

2
 * Time: This is the number of times the hash will get run. This defines the amount of computation required and, as a result, how long the function will take to complete.
2
 * Memory: This is how much RAM is reserved for hashing.
2
 * Parallelism: This is the number of CPU threads that will run in parallel.
2

2
The salt for the password should, at minimum, be 16 bytes for password hashing. It is recommended to use the random_bytes() function.

Returns true if <verb> is callable on <object>, taking into account inheritance, wildcards (star verbs), etc. Otherwise, returns false.  If the caller is permitted to read the object (because the object's `r' flag is true, or the caller is the owner or a wizard) the true value is a list containing the object number of the object that defines the verb and the full verb name(s).  Otherwise, the numeric value `1' is returned.

Syntax:	  sqlite_open(STR <path to database>, [INT options]) => INT
2

2
The function `sqlite_open' will attempt to open the database at <path> for use with SQLite.
2

2
The second argument is a bitmask of options. Options are:
2

2
	SQLITE_PARSE_OBJECTS [4]:    Determines whether strings beginning with a pound symbol (#) are interpreted as MOO object numbers or not.
2
                                     The default is true, which means that any queries that would return a string (such as "#123") will be returned as objects.
2
	SQLITE_PARSE_TYPES [2]:      If unset, no parsing of rows takes place and only strings are returned.
2
	SQLITE_SANITIZE_STRINGS [8]: If set, newlines (\n) are converted into tabs (\t) to avoid corrupting the MOO database. Default is unset.
2

2
NOTE: If the MOO doesn't support bitmasking, you can still specify options. You'll just have to manipulate the int yourself. e.g. if you want to parse objects and types, arg[2] would be a 6. If you only want to parse types, arg[2] would be 2.
2

2
If successful, the function will return the numeric handle for the open database.
2

2
If unsuccessful, the function will return a helpful error message.
2

2
If the database is already open, a traceback will be thrown that contains the already open database handle.

2
Syntax:	  sqlite_close(INT <database handle) => INT
2

2
This function will close an open database.

Syntax:	  sqlite_query(INT <database handle>, STR <database query>[, INT <show columns>]) => [LIST or STR]
2

2
This function will attempt to execute the query given in <query> on the database referred to by <handle>.
2

2
On success, this function will return a list identifying the returned rows. If the query didn't return rows but was successful, an empty list is returned.
2

2
If the query fails, a string will be returned identifying the SQLite error message.
2

2
If <show columns> is true, the return list will include the name of the column before its results.
2

2
WARNING: sqlite_query does NOT use prepared statements and should NOT be used on queries that contain user input.

12
2
Syntax:	  sqlite_execute(INT <database handle>, STR <SQL prepared statement query>, LIST <values>) => [LIST or STR]
2

2
This function will attempt to create and execute the prepared statement query given in <query> on the database referred to by <handle> with the values <values>.
2

2
On success, this function will return a list identifying the returned rows. If the query didn't return rows but was successful, an empty list is returned.
2

2
If the query fails, a string will be returned identifying the SQLite error message.
2

2
sqlite_execute uses prepared statements, so it's the preferred function to use for security and performance reasons.
2

2
Example:
2
sqlite_execute(0, "INSERT INTO users VALUES (?, ?, ?);", {#7, "lisdude", "Albori Sninvel"})

Syntax:   pcre_replace (STR <subject>, STR <pattern>) => STR
2

2
The function `pcre_replace()' replaces <subject> with replacements found in <pattern> using the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library.
2

The pattern string has a specific format that must be followed, which should be familiar if you have used the likes of Vim, Perl, or sed. The string is composed of four elements, each separated by a delimiter (typically a slash (/) or an exclaimation mark (!)), that tell PCRE how to parse your replacement. We'll break the string down and mention relevant options below:
2

2
1. Type of search to perform. In MOO, only 's' is valid. This parameter is kept for the sake of consistency.
2
2. The text you want to search for a replacement.
2
3. The regular expression you want to use for your replacement text.
2
4. Optional modifiers:
2
    g: Global. This will replace all occurances in your string rather than stopping at the first.
2
    i: Case-insensitive. Uppercase, lowercase, it doesn't matter. All will be replaced.
2
    
2
Examples:
2

2
Replace one word with another:
2
pcre_replace("I like banana pie. Do you like banana pie?", "s/banana/apple/g")
2
=> "I like apple pie. Do you like apple pie?"
2

2
If you find yourself wanting to replace a string that contains slashes, it can be useful to change your delimiter to an exclaimation mark:
2
pcre_replace("Unix, wow! /bin/bash is a thing.", "s!/bin/bash!/bin/fish!g")
2
=> "Unix, wow! /bin/fish is a thing."

Syntax:  frandom (FLOAT <mod1> [, FLOAT <mod2>)   => FLOAT
2

2
If only one argument is given, a floating point number is chosen randomly from the range `[1.0..<mod1>]` and returned. If two arguments are given, a floating point number is randomly chosen from the range `[<mod1>..<mod2>]`.

2
Syntax:  memory_usage ()   => LIST
2

2
Return statistics concerning the server's consumption of system memory. The result is a list in the following format:
2

2
{total memory used, resident set size, shared pages, text, data + stack}
36

2
Syntax:  ftime ([INT monotonic])   => FLOAT
2

2
Returns the current time represented as the number of seconds and nanoseconds that have elapsed since midnight on 1 January 1970, Greenwich Mean Time.
2

2
If the <monotonic> argument is supplied and set to 1, the time returned will be monotonic. This means that will you will always get how much time has elapsed from an arbitrary, fixed point in the past that is unaffected by clock skew or other changes in the wall-clock. This is useful for benchmarking how long an operation takes, as it's unaffected by the actual system time.
2

2
The general rule of thumb is that you should use ftime() with no arguments for telling time and ftime() with the monotonic clock argument for measuring the passage of time.

2
Syntax:  clear_ancestor_cache()   => none
2

2
The ancestor cache contains a quick lookup of all of an object's ancestors which aids in expediant property lookups. This is an experimental feature and, as such, you may find that something has gone wrong. If that's that case, this function will completely clear the cache and it will be rebuilt as-needed.

2
Syntax:  locations(OBJ <object>)   => LIST
2

2
Recursively build a list of an object's location, its location's location, and so forth until finally hitting $nothing.
2

2
Example:
2
locations(me)
2
=> {#20381, #443, #104735}
2

2
$string_utils:title_list(locations(me))
2
=> "\"Butterknife Ballet\" Control Room FelElk, the one-person celestial birther \"Butterknife Ballet\", and Uncharted Space: Empty Space"

2
Syntax:  spellcheck(STR <word>)   => INT or LIST
2

2
This function checks the English spelling of <word>. If the spelling is correct, the function will return a 1. If the spelling is incorrect, a LIST of suggestions for correct spellings will be returned instead. If the spelling is incorrect and no suggestions can be found, an empty LIST is returned.
36

2
Syntax:  threads()   => LIST
2

2
When one or more MOO processes are suspended and working in a separate thread, this function will return a LIST of handlers to those threads. These handlers can then be passed to `thread_info' for more information.
36
5
4
6
2
Syntax:  thread_info(INT <thread handler>)   => LIST
2

2
If a MOO task is running in another thread, its thread handler will give you information about that thread. The information returned in a LIST will be:
2

2
  English Name: This is the name the programmer of the builtin function has given to the task being executed.
2
  Active: 1 or 0 depending upon whether or not the MOO task has been killed. Not all threads cleanup immediately after the MOO task dies.

2
Syntax:  waif_stats()   => MAP
2

2
Returns a MAP of statistics about instantiated waifs. Each waif class will be a key in the MAP and its value will be the number of waifs of that class currently instantiated. Additionally, there is a `total' key that will return the total number of instantiated waifs, and a `pending_recycle' key that will return the number of waifs that have been destroyed and are awaiting the call of their :recycle verb.

 Function: FHANDLE file_open(STR pathname, STR mode)
2

2
  Raises: E_INVARG if mode is not a valid mode, E_QUOTA if too many files are open.
2
  This opens a file specified by pathname and returns an FHANDLE for it.
2
  It ensures pathname is legal.  Mode is a string of characters indicating what mode the file is opened in. 
2
  The mode string is four characters.
2

2
  The first character must be (r)ead, (w)rite, or (a)ppend.  The second must be '+' or '-'.  This modifies the previous argument.
2

2
  o  r- opens the file for reading and fails if the file does not exist.
2

2
  o  r+ opens the file for reading and writing and fails if the file
2
     does not exist.
2

2
  o  w- opens the file for writing, truncating if it exists and creating
2
     if not.
2

2
  o  w+ opens the file for reading and writing, truncating if it exists
2
     and creating if not.
2

2
  o  a- opens a file for writing, creates it if it does not exist and
2
     positions the stream at the end of the file.
2

2
  o  a+ opens the file for reading and writing, creates it if does not
2
     exist and positions the stream at the end of the file.
2

2
     The third character is either (t)ext or (b)inary.  In text mode,
2
     data is written as-is from the MOO and data read in by the MOO is
2
     stripped of unprintable characters.  In binary mode, data is
2
     written filtered through the binary-string->raw-bytes conversion
2
     and data is read filtered through the raw-bytes->binary-string
2
     conversion.  For example, in text mode writing " 1B" means three
2
     bytes are written: ' ' Similarly, in text mode reading " 1B" means
2
     the characters ' ' '1' 'B' were present in the file.  In binary
2
     mode reading " 1B" means an ASCII ESC was in the file.  In text
2
     mode, reading an ESC from a file results in the ESC getting
2
     stripped.
2

2
  It is not recommended that files containing unprintable ASCII  data be
2
  read in text mode, for obvious reasons.
2

2
  The final character is either 'n' or 'f'.  If this character is 'f',
2
  whenever data is written to the file, the MOO will force it to finish
2
  writing to the physical disk before returning.  If it is 'n' then
2
  this won't happen.
2

2
  This is implemented using fopen().

  file_type, file_mode, file_last_access, file_last_modify, and
2
  file_last_change be used instead.  In most cases only one of these

Syntax:  occupants(LIST <objects> [, OBJ | LIST <parent>, INT <player flag set?>])   => LIST
2

2
Iterates through the list of <objects> and returns those matching a specific set of criteria:
2

2
1. If only <objects> is specified, the occupants function will return a list of objects with the player flag set.
2
2. If the <parent> argument is specified, a list of <objects> descending from <parent> will be returned. If <parent> is a list, <object> must descend from at least one object in the list.
2
3. If both <parent> and <player flag set> are specified, occupants will check both that an object is descended from <parent> and also has the player flag set.

2
Syntax:  sort(LIST <list> [, LIST <keys>, INT <natural sort order?>, INT <reverse>])   => LIST
2

2
Sorts <list> either by <keys> or using the list itself. When sorting <list> by itself, you can use an empty list ({}) for <keys> to specify additional optional arguments.
2

2
If <natural sort order> is true, strings containing multi-digit numbers will consider those numbers to be a single character. So, for instance, this means that 'x2' would come before 'x11' when sorted naturally because 2 is less than 11. This argument defaults to 0.
2

2
If <reverse> is true, the sort order is reversed. This argument defaults to 0.
2

2
Examples:
2

2
Sort a list by itself:
2
>;sort({"a57", "a5", "a7", "a1", "a2", "a11"})
2
=> {"a1", "a11", "a2", "a5", "a57", "a7"}
2

2
Sort a list by itself with natural sort order:
2
>;sort({"a57", "a5", "a7", "a1", "a2", "a11"}, {}, 1)
2
=> {"a1", "a2", "a5", "a7", "a11", "a57"}
2

2
Sort a list of strings by a list of numeric keys:

Syntax:  yin([INT <time>, INT <minimum ticks>, INT <minimum seconds>] )   => INT
2

2
Suspend the current task if it's running out of ticks or seconds. This is meant to provide similar functionality to the LambdaCore-based suspend_if_needed verb or manually specifying something like: ticks_left() < 2000 && suspend(0)
2

2
Time: How long to suspend the task. Default: 0
2
Minimum ticks: The minimum number of ticks the task has left before suspending.
2
Minimum seconds: The minimum number of seconds the task has left before suspending.

2
Syntax:  slice(LIST <alist> [, INT | LIST | STR <index>, ANY <default map value>])   => LIST
2

2
Return the <index>-th elements of <alist>. By default, index will be 1. If index is a list of integers, the returned list will have those elements from <alist>. This is the built-in equivalent of LambdaCore's $list_utils:slice verb.
2

2
If <alist> is a list of maps, index can be a string indicating a key to return from each map in <alist>.
2

2
If <default map value> is specified, any maps not containing the key <index> will have <default map value> returned in their place. This is useful in situations where you need to maintain consistency with a list index and can't have gaps in your return list.
2

2
Examples:
2
 >slice({{"z", 1}, {"y", 2}, {"x",5}}, 2) => {1, 2, 5}.
2
 >slice({{"z", 1, 3}, {"y", 2, 4}}, {2, 1}) => {{1, "z"}, {2, "y"}}
2
 >;slice({["a" -> 1, "b" -> 2], ["a" -> 5, "b" -> 6]}, "a") => {1, 5}
2

2
Syntax:  set_thread_mode([INT <mode>])
2

2
With no arguments specified, set_thread_mode will return the current thread mode for the verb. A value of 1 indicates that threading is enabled for functions that support it. A value of 0 indicates that threading is disabled and all functions will execute in the main MOO thread, as functions have done in default LambdaMOO since version 1.
2

2
If you specify an argument, you can control the thread mode of the current verb. A <mode> of 1 will enable threading and a <mode> of 0 will disable it. You can invoke this function multiple times if you want to disable threading for a single function call and enable it for the rest.
2

2
When should you disable threading? In general, threading should be disabled in verbs where it would be undesirable to suspend(). Each threaded function will immediately suspend the verb while the thread carries out its work. This can have a negative effect when you want to use these functions in verbs that cannot or should not suspend, like $sysobj:do_command or $sysobj:do_login_command.
2

2
Note that the threading mode affects the current verb only and does NOT affect verbs called from within that verb.

Syntax:  recreate(OBJ <old>, OBJ <parent> [, OBJ <owner>])  => OBJ
2

2
Recreate invalid object <old> (one that has previously been recycle()ed) as <parent>, optionally owned by <owner>. This has the effect of filling in holes created by recycle() that would normally require renumbering and resetting the maximum object.
2

2
The normal rules apply to parent and owner. You either have to own <parent>, <parent> must be fertile, or you have to be a wizard. Similarly, to change <owner>, you should be a wizard. Otherwise it's superfluous.

Syntax:  chr(INT <arg>, ...)  => STR
2

2
This function translates integers into ASCII characters. Each argument must be an integer between 0 and 255.
2
If the programmer is not a wizard, and integers less than 32 are provided, E_INVARG is raised. This prevents control characters or newlines from being written to the database file by non-trusted individuals.

2
Syntax:  next_recycled_object(OBJ <start>)  => OBJ | INT

2
Syntax:	  pcre_match (STR <subject>, STR <pattern> [, <case matters> 0] [, <repeat until no matches> 1]	=> LIST
2

2
The function `pcre_match()' searches <subject> for <pattern> using the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library. The return value is a list of maps containing each match. Each returned map will have a key which corresponds to either a named capture group or the number of the capture group being matched. The full match is always found in the key "0". The value of each key will be another map containing the keys 'match' and 'position'. Match corresponds to the text that was matched and position will return the indices of the substring within <subject>.
2

2
If <repeat until no matches> is 1, the expression will continue to be evaluated until no further matches can be found or it exhausts the iteration limit. This defaults to 1.
2

2
Additionally, wizards can control how many iterations of the loop are possible by adding a property to $server_options. $server_options.pcre_match_max_iterations is the maximum number of loops allowed before giving up and allowing other tasks to proceed. CAUTION: It's recommended to keep this value fairly low. The default value is 1000. The minimum value is 100.

Syntax:	  sqlite_limit(INT <database handle>, STR <category> INT <new value>) => INT
2

2
This function allows you to specify various construct limitations on a per-database basis.
2

2
If <new value> is a negative number, the limit is unchanged. Each limit category has a hardcoded upper bound. Attempts to increase a limit above its hard upper bound are silently truncated to the hard upper bound.
2

2
Regardless of whether or not the limit was changed, the sqlite_limit() function returns the prior value of the limit. Hence, to find the current value of a limit without changing it, simply invoke this interface with the third parameter set to -1.
2

2
As of this writing, the following limits exist:
2

2
LIMIT_LENGTH
2
    The maximum size of any string or BLOB or table row, in bytes.
2

2
LIMIT_SQL_LENGTH
2
    The maximum length of an SQL statement, in bytes.
2

2
LIMIT_COLUMN
2
    The maximum number of columns in a table definition or in the result set of a SELECT or the maximum number of columns in an index or in an ORDER BY or GROUP BY clause.
2

2
LIMIT_EXPR_DEPTH
2
    The maximum depth of the parse tree on any expression.
2

2
LIMIT_COMPOUND_SELECT
2
    The maximum number of terms in a compound SELECT statement.
2

2
LIMIT_VDBE_OP
2
    The maximum number of instructions in a virtual machine program used to implement an SQL statement. If sqlite3_prepare_v2() or the equivalent tries to allocate space for more than this many opcodes in a single prepared statement, an SQLITE_NOMEM error is returned.
2

2
LIMIT_FUNCTION_ARG
2
    The maximum number of arguments on a function.
2

2
LIMIT_ATTACHED
2
    The maximum number of attached databases.
2

2
LIMIT_LIKE_PATTERN_LENGTH
2
    The maximum length of the pattern argument to the LIKE or GLOB operators.
2

2
LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER
2
    The maximum index number of any parameter in an SQL statement.
2

2
LIMIT_TRIGGER_DEPTH
2
    The maximum depth of recursion for triggers.
2

2
LIMIT_WORKER_THREADS
2
    The maximum number of auxiliary worker threads that a single prepared statement may start.
2

Syntax:	  curl(STR <url> [, INT <include_headers>]) => STR
2

2
The curl builtin will download a webpage and return it as a string. If <include_headers> is true, the HTTP headers will be included in the return string.
2

2
It's worth noting that the data you get back will be binary encoded. In particular, you will find that line breaks appear as ~0A. You can easily convert a page into a list by passing the return string into the decode_binary() function.

2
Syntax:  connection_name_lookup (OBJ <connection> [, INT record_result])   => STR
2

2
This function performs a DNS name lookup on connection's IP address. If a hostname can't be resolved, the function simply returns the numeric IP address. Otherwise, it will return the resolved hostname.
2

2
If record_result is true, the resolved hostname will be saved with the connection and will overwrite it's existing 'connection_name()'. This means that you can call 'connection_name_lookup()' a single time when a connection is created and then continue to use 'connection_name()' as you always have in the past.
2

2
This function is primarily intended for use when the 'NO_NAME_LOOKUP' server option is set. Barring temporarily failures in your nameserver, very little will be gained by calling this when the server is performing DNS name lookups for you.
2

2
NOTE: This function runs in a separate thread. While this is good for performance (long lookups won't lock your MOO like traditional pre-2.6.0 name lookups), it also means it will require slightly more work to create an entirely in-database DNS lookup solution. Because it explicitly suspends, you won't be able to use it in 'do_login_command()' without also using the 'switch_player()' function. For an example of how this can work, see '#0:do_login_command()' in ToastCore.

Syntax:  connection_info (OBJ <connection>)   => LIST
2

2
Returns a MAP of network connection information for <connection>. At the time of writing, the following information is returned:
2

2
destination_address: The hostname of the connection. For incoming connections, this is the hostname of the connected user.
2
                     For outbound connections, this is the hostname of the outbound connection's destination.
2

2
destination_ip:      The unresolved numeric IP address of the connection.
2

2
destination_port:    For incoming connections, this is the local port used to make the connection.
2
                     For outbound connections, this is the port the connection was made to.
2

2
source_address:      This is the hostname of the interface an incoming connection was made on. For outbound connections, this value is meaningless.
2

2
source_ip:           The unresolved numeric IP address of the interface a connection was made on. For outbound connections, this value is meaningless.
2

2
source_port:         The local port a connection connected to. For outbound connections, this value is meaningless.
2

2
protocol:            Describes the protocol used to make the connection. At the time of writing, this could be IPv4 or IPv6.

2
Syntax: maphaskey (MAP <map>, STR <key>)   => INT

Syntax:  finished_tasks ()   => LIST
2

2
When enabled (via SAVE_FINISHED_TASKS in options.h), the server will keep track of the execution time of every task that passes through the interpreter. This data is then made available to the database in two ways.
2

2
The first is the finished_tasks() function. This function will return a list of maps of the last several finished tasks (configurable via $server_options.finished_tasks_limit) with the following information:
2

2

2
Foreground:    True if this was a foreground task.
2
Fullverb:      The full name of the verb being executed.
2
Object:        The object the verb is defined on.
2
Player:        The result of the 'player' variable.
2
Programmer:    The player whose permissions the verb is running as.
2
Receiver:      The object that received the verb invocation. In the case of primitives, this is the primitive's object handler.
2
Suspended:     True if the task suspended instead of finishing.
2
This:          The result of the 'this' variable.
2
Time:          The total time the task took inside the interpreter.
2
Verb:          The verb name used to invoke the task.
2

2

2
The second is via the $handle_lagging_task verb. When the execution threshold defined in $server_options.task_lag_threshold is exceeded, the server will write an entry to the log file and call the $handle_lagging_task verb with the call stack of the task as well as the execution time.

Syntax:  owned_objects(OBJ owner)  => LIST

2
Syntax:  ancestors(OBJ <object> [, INT <full>])   => LIST

2
Return a list of all ancestors of <object> in order ascending up the inheritance hiearchy. If <full> is true, <object> will be included in the list.
36

3
2
Syntax:  descendants(OBJ <object> [, INT <full>])   => LIST

2
Syntax:  panic([STR <message>])
2

2
Unceremoniously shut down the server, mimicking the behavior of a fatal error. The database will NOT be dumped to the file specified when starting the server. A new file will be created with the name of your database appended with .PANIC.
36

2
Syntax:  thread_pool(STR <function>, STR <pool> [, INT <value>])
2

2
This function allows you to control any thread pools that the server created at startup. It should be used with care, as it has the potential to create disasterous consequences if used incorrectly.
2

2
The <function> parameter is the function you wish to perform on the thread pool. The functions available are:
2

2
   INIT: Control initialization of a thread pool.
2

2
   
2
The <pool> parameter controls which thread pool you wish to apply the designated function to. At the time of writing, the server creates the following thread pool:
2

2
   MAIN: The main thread pool where threaded built-in function work takes place.
2

2

2
Finally, <value> is the value you want to pass to the <function> of <pool>. The following functions accept the following values:
2

2
   INIT: The number of threads to spawn. NOTE: When executing this function, the existing <pool> will be destroyed and a new one created in its place.
2

2

2
Examples:
2
;thread_pool("INIT", "MAIN", 1)     => Replace the existing main thread pool with a new pool consisting of a single thread.
36

2
Syntax:  is_member (ANY value, LIST list, INT case-sensitive)   => INT
2

2
Returns the index of <value> if there is an element of <list> that is completely indistinguishable from <value>. This is much the same operation as "<value> in <list>" except that, unlike `in', the `is_member()' function does not treat upper- and lower-case characters in strings as equal. This treatment of strings can be controlled with the <case-sensitive> argument; setting <case-sensitive> to false will effectively disable this behavior.
2

2
Raises E_ARGS if two values are given or if more than three arguments are given. Raises E_TYPE if the second argument is not a list. Otherwise returns the index of <value> in <list>, or 0 if it's not in there.
2

2
  is_member(3, {3, 10, 11})                  => 1
2
  is_member("a", {"A", "B", "C"})            => 0
2
  is_member("XyZ", {"XYZ", "xyz", "XyZ"})    => 3
2
  is_member("def", {"ABC", "DEF", "GHI"}, 0) => 2

18
2
Syntax:  listen (OBJ <object>, INT <port> [, MAP <options>])   => value
2

2
Create a new point at which the server will listen for network connections, just as it does normally. <Object> is the object whose verbs `do_login_command', `do_command', `do_out_of_band_command', `user_connected', `user_created', `user_reconnected', `user_disconnected', and `user_client_disconnected' will be called at appropriate points as these verbs are called on #0 for normal connections. (See the chapter in the LambdaMOO Programmer's Manual on server assumptions about the database for the complete story on when these functions are called.) <Port> is a TCP port number on which to listen. The listen() function will return <port> unless <port> is zero, in which case the return value is a port number assigned by the operating system.
2

2
An optional third argument allows you to set various miscellaneous options for the listening point. These are:
2

2
  print-messages: If true, the various database-configurable messages (also detailed in the chapter on server assumptions) will be printed on connections received at the new listening port.
2
  ipv6:           Use the IPv6 protocol rather than IPv4.
2
  tls:            Only accept valid secure TLS connections.
2
  certificate:    The full path to a TLS certificate. NOTE: Requires the TLS option also be specified and true. This option is only necessary if the certificate differs from the one specified in options.h.
2
  key:            The full path to a TLS private key. NOTE: Requires the TLS option also be specified and true. This option is only necessary if the key differs from the one specified in options.h.
2

2
listen() raises E_PERM if the programmer is not a wizard, E_INVARG if <object> is invalid or there is already a listening point described by <point>, and E_QUOTA if some network-configuration-specific error occurred.
2

2

2
Example:
2
>;listen(#0, 1234, ["ipv6" -> 1, "tls" -> 1, "certificate" -> "/etc/certs/something.pem", "key" -> "/etc/certs/privkey.pem", "print-messages" -> 1]
2
Listen for IPv6 connections on port 1234 and print messages as appropriate. These connections must be TLS and will use the private key and certificate found in /etc/certs.

2
Syntax:  move (OBJ <what>, OBJ <where>[, INT <position>])   => none
2

2
Changes <what>'s location to be <where>.  This is a complex process because a number of permissions checks and notifications must be performed. The actual movement takes place as described in the following paragraphs.
2

2
<what> should be a valid object and <where> should be either a valid object or `#-1' (denoting a location of 'nowhere'); otherwise E_INVARG is raised.  The programmer must be either the owner of <what> or a wizard; otherwise, E_PERM is raised.
2

2
If <where> is a valid object and isn't the same as <what>'s location, then the verb-call
2

2
    <where>:accept(<what>)
2

2
is performed before any movement takes place.  If the verb returns a false value and the programmer is not a wizard, then <where> is considered to have refused entrance to <what>; `move()' raises E_NACC.  If <where> does not define an `accept' verb, then it is treated as if it defined one that always returned false.
2

2
If moving <what> into <where> would create a loop in the containment hierarchy (i.e., <what> would contain itself, even indirectly), then E_RECMOVE is raised instead.
2

2
The `location' property of <what> is changed to be <where>, and the `contents' properties of the old and new locations are modified appropriately.  If <position> is specified, the object will be inserted into the `contents' property of the new location at <position>.
2

2
If <where> differs from <what>'s current location, two additional verb calls take place.  Let <old-where> be the location of <what> before it was moved.  If <old-where> is a valid object, then the verb-call
2

2
    <old-where>:exitfunc(<what>)
2

2
is performed and its result is ignored; it is not an error if <old-where> does not define a verb named `exitfunc'.  Finally, if <where> and <what> are still valid objects, and <where> is still the location of <what>, then the verb-call
2

2
    <where>:enterfunc(<what>)
2

2
is performed and its result is ignored; again, it is not an error if <where> does not define a verb named `enterfunc'.
36

4
21
2
Syntax:  open_network_connection (STR <host>, INT <port> [, MAP <options>])   => obj
2

2
Establishes a network connection to the place specified by the arguments and more-or-less pretends that a new, normal player connection has been established from there.  The new connection, as usual, will not be logged in initially and will have a negative object number associated with it for use with `read()', `notify()', and `boot_player()'.  This object number is the value returned by this function.
2

2
If the programmer is not a wizard or if the `OUTBOUND_NETWORK' compilation option was not used in building the server, then `E_PERM' is raised.
2

2
<Host> refers to a string naming a host (possibly a numeric IP address) and <port> is an integer referring to a TCP port number.  If a connection cannot be made because the host does not exist, the port does not exist, the host is not reachable or refused the connection, `E_INVARG' is raised.  If the connection cannot be made for other reasons, including resource limitations, then `E_QUOTA' is raised.
2

2
Optionally, you can specify a map with any or all of the following options:
2

2
  listener: An object whose listening verbs will be called at appropriate points. (See HELP LISTEN() for more details.)
2
  tls:      If true, establish a secure TLS connection.
2
  ipv6:     If true, utilize the IPv6 protocol rather than the IPv4 protocol.
2

2
The outbound connection process involves certain steps that can take quite a long time, during which the server is not doing anything else, including responding to user commands and executing MOO tasks.  See the chapter on server assumptions about the database for details about how the server limits the amount of time it will wait for these steps to successfully complete.
2

2
It is worth mentioning one tricky point concerning the use of this function.  Since the server treats the new connection pretty much like any normal player connection, it will naturally try to parse any input from that connection as commands in the usual way.  To prevent this treatment, you should use `set_connection_option()' to set the `hold-input' option true on the connection.
2

2
Example:
2
>;open_network_connection("2607:5300:60:4be0::", 1234, ["ipv6" -> 1, "listener" -> #6, "tls" -> 1])
2
Open a new connection to the IPv6 address 2607:5300:60:4be0:: on port 1234 using TLS. Relevant verbs will be called on #6.

Syntax:  reverse(LIST <alist>) => LIST

Syntax:	  sqlite_interrupt(INT <database handle>)
2

2
This function causes any pending database operation to abort at its earliest opportunity. If the operation is nearly finished when sqlite_interrupt is called, it might not have an opportunity to be interrupted and could continue to completion.
2

2
This can be useful when you execute a long-running query and want to abort it.
2

2
NOTE: As of this writing (server version 2.7.0) the @kill command WILL NOT abort operations taking place in a helper thread. If you want to interrupt an SQLite query, you must use sqlite_interrupt and NOT the @kill command.

Function: str string_hash (str string, [, algo])
2
Function: str binary_hash (str bin-string, [, algo])
2

2
string_hash -- Returns a 64-character hexadecimal string.
2
binary_hash -- Returns a 64-character hexadecimal string.
2

2
Returns a 64-character hexadecimal string encoding the result of applying the SHA256 cryptographically secure hash function to the contents of the string text or the binary string bin-string. If algo is provided, it specifies the hashing algorithm to use. "MD5", "SHA1" and "SHA256" are all supported.
2

2
Note that the MD5 hash algorithm is broken from a cryptographic standpoint, as is SHA1. Both are included for interoperability with existing applications (both are still popular).
2

2
All supported hash functions have the property that, if
2

2
string_hash(x) == string_hash(y)
2

2
then, almost certainly,
2

2
equal(x, y)
2

2
This can be useful, for example, in certain networking applications: after sending a large piece of text across a connection, also send the result of applying string_hash() to the text; if the destination site also applies string_hash() to the text and gets the same result, you can be quite confident that the large text has arrived unchanged.

Assume we have a file `test.txt` with the contents:
2

asdf asdf 11

2

2
And we have an open file handler from running:
2

2
;file_open("test.txt", "r-tn")
2

2
If we were to execute a file grep:
2

2
;file_grep(1, "11")
2

2
We would get the first result:
2

2
{{"asdf asdf 11", 1}}
2

2
The resulting LIST is of the form {{STR match, INT line-number}}
2

2
If you pass in the optional third argument
2

2
;file_grep(1, "11", 1)
2

we will receive all the matching results:

Function: INT notify (OBJ conn, STR string [, INT no-flush [, INT suppress-newline]])
2

2
Enqueues <string> for output (on a line by itself) on the connection <conn>. If the programmer is not <conn> or a wizard, then E_PERM is raised. If <conn> is not a currently-active connection, then this function does nothing. Output is normally written to connections only between tasks, not during execution.
2

2
The server will not queue an arbitrary amount of output for a connection; the `MAX_QUEUED_OUTPUT' compilation option (in `options.h') controls the limit. When an attempt is made to enqueue output that would take the server over its limit, it first tries to write as much output as possible to the connection without having to wait for the other end. If that doesn't result in the new output being able to fit in the queue, the server starts throwing away the oldest lines in the queue until the new output will fit. The server remembers how many lines of output it has `flushed' in this way and, when next it can succeed in writing anything to the connection, it first writes a line like `>> Network buffer overflow; X lines of output to you have been lost <<' where <X> is the number of of flushed lines.
2

2
If <no-flush> is provided and true, then `notify()' never flushes any output from the queue; instead it immediately returns false. `Notify()' otherwise always returns true.
2

2
If no-flush is provided and true, then `notify()` never flushes any output from the queue; instead it immediately returns false. `Notify()` otherwise always returns true.

Function: LIST queue_info([obj user])

         MAP queue_info([obj user])

Returns the number of forked tasks that <user> has at the moment.  Since it doesn't say which tasks, security is not a significant issue.  If no argument is given, then gives a list of all users with task queues in the server.  (Essentially all connected players + all open connections + all users with tasks running in the background.)

2
If the caller is a wizard a map of debug information about task queues will be returned.

2
Syntax:  queued_tasks ([INT <show runtime> [, INT count-only])   => LIST
2

2
Returns information on each of the background tasks (i.e., forked, suspended, or reading)  owned by the programmer (or, if the programmer is a wizard, all queued tasks). The returned value is a list of lists, each of which encodes certain information about a particular queued task in the following format:
2

2
    {<task-id>, <start-time>, <ticks>, <clock-id>,
2
     <programmer>, <verb-loc>, <verb-name>, <line>, <this>, <task-size>}
2

2
where <task-id> is a numeric identifier for this queued task, <start-time> is the time after which this task will begin execution (in `time()' format), <ticks> is the number of ticks this task will have when it starts (always 20,000 now, though this is changeable. This makes this value obsolete and no longer interesting), <clock-id> is a number whose value is no longer interesting, <programmer> is the permissions with which this task will begin execution (and also the player who "owns" this task), <verb-loc> is the object on which the verb that forked this task was defined at the time, <verb-name> is that name of that verb, <line> is the number of the first line of the code in that verb that this task will execute, and <this> is the value of the variable `this' in that verb. For reading tasks, <start-time> is `-1'.  <task-size> is in bytes, and is the size of memory in use by the task for local variables, stack frames, etc.

If <show runtime> is true, all variables present in the task are presented in a map with the variable name as the key and its value as the value.     
2

2
If `count-only` is true, then only the number of tasks is returned. This is significantly more performant than length(queued_tasks()). 
2

2
The <ticks> and <clock-id> fields are now obsolete and are retained only for backward-compatibility reasons.  They may disappear in a future version of the server.

Function: int random ([INT mod [,INT range]])
2

2
random -- Return a random integer 
2

2
mod must be a positive integer; otherwise, E_INVARG is raised. If mod is not provided, it defaults to the largest MOO integer, which will depend on if you are running 32 or 64bit.
2

2
if range is provided then an integer in the range of mod to range (inclusive) is returned.
2

2
random(10)                  => integer between 1-10
2
random()                    => integer between 1 and maximum integer supported
2
random(1, 5000)             => integer between 1 and 5000

Function: task_stack (INT task-id [, INT include-line-numbers [, INT include-variables])  => LIST
2

2
Returns information like that returned by the `callers()' function, but for the suspended task with the given <task-id>; the <include-line-numbers> argument has the same meaning as in `callers()'. Raises E_INVARG if <task-id> does not specify an existing suspended task and E_PERM if the programmer is neither a wizard nor the owner of the specified task.
2

2
If include-line-numbers is passed and true, line numbers will be included.
2

2
If include-variables is passed and true, variables will be included with each frame of the provided task.

Function: str value_hash(value, [,STR algo])
2

2
Returns the same string as string_hash(toliteral(value)).

Password Verifier
2
==================
2

2
To check for the validity of a password, use
2
  :reject_password( password [, for-whom? ] )
2
... If it returns a true value, that value will contain the string representing the reason why the password was rejected.  If it returns a false value, the password is OK.
2

2
The toggle switches for this checking are:

Utility verbs for manipulating lists as vectors (one dimensional lists) or as matrices (two dimensional lists).
2

2
Some definitions:
2
A VECTOR is a list of INTs or a list of FLOATs. Each element in the list represents the vector's cartesian coordinate as measured from its tail to its tip. (For instance, {3, 4} represents a vector in the x-y plane with an x component of 3 and a y component of 4. {-2, 5, 10} represents a vector in 3-space with a x component of -2, a y component of 5 and a z component of 10.)
2
A MATRIX is a list of VECTORs, all of which have the same number (and type) of components.
2

2
Vector verbs:
2
:vector_add        (V1 [,V2 ...]) => VN such that VN[n] = V1[n] + V2[n]...
2
:vector_sub        (V1 [,V2 ...]) => VN such that VN[n] = V1[n] - V2[n]...
2
:scalar_vector_mul (V, S)         => VN such that VN[n] = V[n] * S...
2
:scalar_vector_div (V, S)         => VN such that VN[n] = V[n] / S...
2
:dot_prod          (V1, V2)       => NUM sum of the products of the 
2
:inner_prod                          corresponding elements of the two
2
                                     vectors.
2
:cross_prod        (V1, V2)       => VN, the vector perpendicular to both V1
2
:outer_prod                          and V2 with length equal to the area of
2
                                     the parallelogram spanned by V1 and V2.
2
:subtended_angle   (V1, V2)       => FLOAT smallest radian angle defined by
2
                                     V1 and V2.
2
:length            (V)            => FLOAT length of the vector. 
2
:norm
2

2
Matrix and Vector verbs:
2
:dimensions (M) => LIST of dimensional sizes
2
:order      (M) => NUM of dimensions
2

2
Matrix verbs:
2
:matrix_add (M1 [,M2 ...]) => MN such that MN[m][n] = M1[m][n] + M2[m][n]...
2
:matrix_sub (M1 [,M2 ...]) => MN such that MN[m][n] = M1[m][n] - M2[m][n]...
2
:matrix_mul (M1, M2)       => MN such than MN[m][n] = the dot product of the  
2
                              mth row of M1 and the nth column of M2.
2
:scalar_matrix_mul (M, S)  => MN such that MN[m][n] = M[m][n] * S...
2
:scalar_matrix_div (M, S)  => MN such that MN[m][n] = M[m][n] / S...
2
:transpose  (M1)           => M2 such that the rows in M1 are the columns in
2
                              M2 and vice versa.
2
:identity   (INT <size>)   => Identity matrix (I) of dimensions <size> by 
2

2
:is_null     (M) => 1 iff M is O.
2

2
The MOO has a built in spelling checker.  There are several player commands which access the database, as well as some programming features available.  Additional documentation is available under individual commands.
2

2
The spelling checker is backed by the Aspell interface.  Additionally, players have a personal dictionary that can be used to augment the main dictionary.
2

2
@spell a word or phrase - Spell check a word or phrase.
2
@spell thing.prop - Spell check a property. The value must be a string or a list of strings.
2
@spell thing:verb - Spell check a verb. Only the quoted strings in the verb are checked.
2
@spellproperties object - Spell check all text properties of an object.
2
@spellmessages object - Spell check only message properties of an object.
2
@cspell word - Spell check a word, and if it is not in the dictionary, offers suggestions about what the right spelling might be. This actually works with thing.prop and thing:verb too, but it is too slow to be useful--it takes maybe 30 seconds per unknown word.
2
@addword word - Add a word to your personal dictionary.
2
@rmword word - Remove a word from your personal dictionary.
2

2
Questions and comments should be directed to waffle on LambdaMOO.

2
Syntax: @spell <any number of words>
2
           - will check the words from the command line.
2
        @spell object.property
2
           - will spellcheck the contents of a prop. Must be a string or
2
             list of strings.
2
        @spell object:verb
2
           - will check everything within quoted strings in a verb. E.g.,
2
             only the quoted part of player:tell("Spellchecking is fun.");
2
             will be examined for errors.

2
Like @spell, but attempts to guess at correct spellings for words it believes are spelled incorrectly.   This verb can be quite slow, so correcting large chunks of text may not be a good idea.

2
Syntax: @addword <word or words>
2
        @addword object.property

Will add all words found and unknown into your personal dictionary.
2
Your dictionary is stored in a property named ".dict".

2
  @find #<object>   - locate an object by number
2
  @find <player>    - locate a player
2
  @find :<verb>     - locate a verb on an object in your vicinity
2
  @find .<property> - locate a property on objects in your vicinity.
2
  @find ?<topic>    - locate a help topic on a help database.
2

2
For example, '@find frand' shows Frand's number and location. '@find :jump' lists every object in the same room as you (including you and the room itself) which has a 'jump' verb.  For properties and verbs, output is a list of pairs of objects: each object on which the property or verb exists, and the ancestor that actually defines it.
36

2
When you aren't in the same room with an object, you have to refer to it by number. When teleporting, that means you usually have to give your destination as a number. To avoid this, Frand's player class provides a way for you to store a database of rooms by name. If the library is in your list of rooms, you can just '@go library' to teleport there. Or '@move book to lib' to teleport an object there.
2

2
  @rooms                     - see a list of the rooms you know by name
2
  @addr*oom <name> <number>  - remember a room by name
2
  @rmr*oom  <name>           - forget about a room's name
2

2
For example, to add the kitchen to your database of rooms, type '@addr Kitchen #24'. To remove it, type '@rmr kitchen'.

2
  @join <player>             - teleport yourself to a player's location
2

2
You can teleport an object (if it allows this) to any location that will accept it. For example, `@move rock to #11' will teleport the rock to the closet. `@move #123 to here' will move object #123 to your location. `@go home' will teleport you home. `@join yduj' will teleport you to yduJ's location. You can also teleport an object to #-1, which is nowhere.
2

2
See help teleport-messages for information on customizing the text that appears
2
(both to you and to others in the vicinity) when you teleport.
2
See also help @rooms for information on naming rooms for convenient movement.
2
If @move doesn't work and you own the place where the object is located, try using @eject instead.

2
Teleporting using @go, @move, or @join causes various messages to appear. The messages are defined on you as properties. Here are the messages, who sees them, and when.
2

2
 when you teleport -  yourself      a player        a thing
2

2
           you see -  self_port     player_port     thing_port
2
        others see -  oself_port    oplayer_port    othing_port
2
  destination sees -  self_arrive   player_arrive   thing_arrive
2
   teleportee sees -                victim_port     object_port
2

2
When you @join a player, your join message is printed to you.
2

2
You can set the messages with commands like '@oself_port me is "vanishes in a shimmering haze."', '@join me is "You visit %n."', and so on.
2

2
The messages to you are printed as they stand. The messages to others are printed after your name. If you set a message to "", the null string, nothing will print for that message. But if you have a non-empty message which does not include your name, then your name will be added in front of the message. You can use the usual pronoun substitutions, like '%n' to refer to the object you are teleporting. You can also use the special substitutions %<from room> and %<to room> to refer to the original and destination rooms for the teleport.
2

2
If you are leaving your name out of the messages, and relying on its being inserted automatically, you have to be careful about the substitutions you use. If Frand has an oself_port message "jumps to %<to room>.", for example, and Frand teleports to Frand's MOOhome, the message printed will be "jumps to Frand's MOOhome." My name is there, so it isn't added in. If you want to include your name as a substitution, the one to use is %t, 'this'. "%t jumps to %<to room>." will work.

2
The refusal facility allows you to ignore specific actions by players. You can ignore all mail that Stupid_Jerk (#34567) sends you, for
2
example, or you can ignore all whispers and pages, no matter who they are from.
2

2
There are three basic refusal commands. They are explained below.
2

2
    @refuse <action> from <player>
2
    @unrefuse <action> from <player>
2
    @refusals
2

2
The actions you can refuse are page, whisper, mail, move, join, and accept. These are explained in a table farther down.
2

2
For example, '@refuse mail from Stupid_Jerk'. Any future mail that Stupid_Jerk sends you will be dropped on the floor, and Stupid_Jerk will
2
be told that you refused to receive it. The refusal stays active for a week; after the week is over, Stupid_Jerk's mail will again get
2
through. (If you want the refusal to last a longer or shorter time, keep on reading.)
2

2
You can refuse more than one action at a time. '@refuse page whisper from Stupid_Jerk' refuses both pages and whispers.
2

2
You can also refuse actions from everybody.
2

2
    @refuse <actions>
2

2
For example, '@refuse page' refuses every page. These refusals are listed as refusals of 'everybody' when you use the @refusals command,
2
below.
2

2
See `help @unrefuse' and `help @refusal-reporting' for information on undoing refusals and finding out what you're refusing.
2

2
 - the actions
2

2
The actions everybody can refuse are page, whisper, mail, move, and join.
2
refuse other things as well, depending on your player class.
2

2
 refuse this      to prevent somebody from doing this
2
 -----------      -----------------------------------
2
    page        - tell you a message with the 'page' command
2
    whisper     - tell you a message with the 'whisper' or 'murmur' command
2
    mail        - send you a MOOmail message via @send
2
    move        - teleport you
2
    join        - enter the same room as you (only works in a some rooms)
2
    accept      - hand you an object (or teleport it to you)
2
    flames      - posts are suppressed on mail lists
2
    politics    - set yourself `apolitical' [see `help apolitical']
2
    all         - all of the above
2

2
Refusing move is a little tricky. The player will not be able to teleport you, but you will not be able to pass through any special exits
2
that the player may have programmed either. Refusing move means refusing *all* movement, including movement through programmed exits.
2
Fortunately most exits are plain exits, and you will always be able to pass through them. Only specially programmed exits by the player you
2
are refusing move from are barred to you.
2

2
Refusing join only works in special rooms that support it.
2

2
 - time limits
2

2
Refusals expire after a certain amount of time has gone by. Unless you say otherwise, they expire after a week. You can add '... for
2
<time>' to the end of a @refuse command:
2

2
    @refuse <action> from <player> for <time>
2
    @refuse <action> for <time>
2

2
For example, '@refuse join from Stupid_Jerk for 3 days'.
2

2
The <time> is always a number followed by a unit, like '10 weeks' or '45 seconds'. The possible units are second, minute, hour, day, week,
2
and month.

2
Syntax:
2
    @unrefuse <actions> from <player>
2

2
If Stupid_Jerk reforms, you can change your mind. '@unrefuse mail from Stupid_Jerk' will remove the refusal.
2

2
'@unrefuse' can also be called '@allow', for those who prefer English over clarity.
2

2
    @unrefuse <actions>
2

2
If you don't mention a player, you remove only refusals that apply to everybody. '@unrefuse page' turns off any '@refuse page' command you
2
gave before, but does not affect refusals of specific players. You will still be refusing pages from Stupid_Jerk, if you were before.
2

2
    @unrefuse everything
2

2
 If you '@unrefuse everything', all your refusals are removed. This command asks if you are sure before erasing them all.

[See help @refuse for a discussion of the refusal facility]
2

2
    @refusals
2
    @refusals for <player>
2

2
List the players and actions you are refusing, or the players and actions that another player is refusing. For example, you can see if
2
Stupid_Jerk is refusing your mail too: '@refusals for Stupid_Jerk'.
2

2
Normally refusal works without your awareness. You don't even notice when Stupid_Jerk attempts to send you mail. If you would rather be
2
notified when it happens (so you can thumb your nose), then do
2

2
    @refusal-reporting on
2

2
Actually, all you need to type is '@refusal-r on'. You will see a message like 'Mail from Stupid_Jerk (#34567) refused.' as soon as
2
Stupid_Jerk types 'send' in the mail editor.
2

2
Refusal reporting only works for some actions. It works for page, whisper, and mail, but not for move, join or accept. Sorry.
2

2
You will only be notified if you are connected when the refusal happens. If you are not connected when Stupid_Jerk tries to send you mail,
2
you won't know about it, no matter whether refusal reporting is on or off.
2

2
You can turn off refusal reporting with '@refusal-r off'. You can check whether it is on or off with '@refusal-r'. Here's the list:
2

2
    @refusal-reporting on     - turn on refusal reporting
2
    @refusal-reporting off    - turn off refusal reporting
2
    @refusal-reporting        - see whether it is on or off

  -- -- --  refusal programming
2

2
This entry explains how to program new kinds of refusal for the refusal mechanism. This information is only useful for programmers. For basic information about the refusal mechanism, read the 'refusal' entry.
2

2
 - making a new refusable action
2

2
Making a refusable action has several steps. You have to (1) override the verb that lists your refusable actions, (2) write a verb to handle any special cases in determining when an action should be refused, and (3) write the code that does the actual acceptance or refusal of the action.
2

2
You can put new refusable actions on yourself, or on a player class. If you put them on yourself, then you are the only one who can use them. If you put them on a player class, then everyone who belongs to that class can use them.
2

2
I'll walk you through the example of making a refusable action 'smirk'. If you '@refuse smirk from Munchkin' then anything Munchkin tells you with the word 'smirk' in it will be refused. Since this is useless, I'll assume that you're defining it on yourself, instead of on a player class.
2

2
(1) You have to make 'smirk' a refusable action. You do that by overriding your :refusable_actions verb. :Refusable_actions is a verb which returns the actions that you know how to refuse. It is a verb instead of a property so that players can add refusable actions at all levels of the player class hierarchy without interfering with each other.
2

2
    @verb me:refusable_actions this none this
2
    @program me:refusable_actions
2
      return {@pass(@args), "smirk"};
2
    .
2

2
'@pass (@args)' means 'include the actions that my parent knows how to refuse, because I know how to refuse them too.'
2

2
(2) The refusal mechanism provides for special cases in deciding whether an action should be refused. None of the refusals defined on Frand's Player Class actually make use of this special case, and you probably won't have to use it either. But you still have to write a verb to deal with it.
2

2
The verb should be named :refuses_action_<action>, where <action> is the action that the verb is for. In this case, it should be :refuses_action_smirk. The verb takes some arguments and returns whether the action should be refused. The details of this will someday be explained in the next section, 'fancy refusable actions', but in all simple cases the verb should simply return 1.
2

2
    @verb me:refuses_action_smirk this none this
2
    @program me:refuses_action_smirk
2
      return 1;
2
    .
2

2
(3) Finally you must implement the refusal itself. The code that performs the action should call <target>:refuses_action (player, <action>). <target> is the target of the action; it is you, because others are smirking at you. 'Player' is the current player, the one who is attempting to perform the action. <action> is the action the player is attempting, 'smirk'.
2

2
In this case, you want to change your :tell verb to check whether its message contains the word 'smirk', and whether you are refusing smirks from the player who's talking. It also has to do two other things: (1) inform the player whose smirk was refused, and (2) call this:report_refusal, which tests whether you have refusal reporting turned on, and if so, reports the refusal to you. The call is this:report_refusal (<player>, <message>).
2

2
    @verb me:tell this none this
2
    @program me:tell
2
      line = tostr (@args);
2
      if (index (line, "smirk") &&
2
          this:refuses_action (player, "smirk"))
2
        player:tell (this.name, " refuses your s m i r k.");
2
        this:report_refusal (player, "You refused a s m i r k.");
2
      else
2
        pass (@args);
2
      endif
2
    .
2

2
The messages say 's m i r k' instead of 'smirk' to prevent an infinite :tell loop.
2

2
It may help to study some examples. To see how whisper refusal works, read #3133:whisper. For page refusal, see #3133:receive_page and #3133:page_echo_msg. For mail refusal, #3133:receive_message. For move and accept refusal, #3133:moveto or #3133:accept (they are the same verb).
2

2
 - refusal data structures
2

2
Refusal information is stored in four main properties, all lists.
2

2
    .refused_origins    - who you are refusing actions from
2
    .refused_actions    - for each, what actions you're refusing
2
    .refused_until      - when the refusals expire
2
    .refused_extra      - any further information about each refused action
2

2
These properties are all readable and owned by Frand. You (or anyone) can see their values, but you can only change them by calling verbs for the purpose. The verbs are explained later on.
2

2
Your .refused_origins property remembers who you are refusing actions from. It might have the value {#47, #34567} if you are refusing actions from Frand (#47) and Stupid_Jerk (#34567). If you are refusing actions by guests, it will have entries like "xxP1Xw.nkQzft". This weird string is a code word that stands for the guest's connection site; you are refusing actions not by a certain guest character, but by any guest who may connect from that site. The verb :player_to_refusal_origin (<player>) converts a player object to a refusal origin (either the same player object or a guest's site code) suitable to be stored in .refused_origins.
2

2
Your .refused_actions property stores, for each origin in .refused_origins, a list of the actions you are refusing for that origin. Continuing the example from the last paragraph, if you are refusing page from Frand and page, whisper, and mail from Stupid_Jerk, then your .refused_actions has the value {{"page"}, {"page", "whisper", "mail"}}.
2

2
Your .refused_until stores an expiration time for each refusal origin, in the form used by time(), the number of seconds since midnight, 1 January 1970, GMT. All actions that you are refusing from a given player expire at the same time. If you are refusing Frand until 19 December 1992, and Stupid_Jerk for seven years, your .refused_until might have the value {724763397, 928384392}.
2

2
Your .refused_extra property stores any additional information needed for fancy refusals. It stores one piece of information for every action you are refusing from every player. In other words, .refused_extra contains a list of lists which are parallel to the lists in .refused_actions. None of the built-in refusals on #3133 is fancy, so for them, the extra piece of information is always 0. In the example, your .refused_extra has the value {{0}, {0, 0, 0}}. The next section explains how to use .refused_extra in fancy refusals.
2

2
Another property, .default_refusal_time, stores the duration in seconds that a refusal lasts by default. This property is readable and owned by Frand. Its value is usually 604800, seven days. You can set it via the verb :set_default_refusal_time.
2

2
 - fancy refusable actions
2

2
THIS SECTION IS NOT YET WRITTEN
2

2
 - selective refusal reporting
2

2
If you have done '@refusal-reporting on', then you see a message when you refuse somebody else's action (for some actions). This reporting is done by the verb :report_refusal.
2

2
    :report_refusal (<player>, <message>, ...)
2

2
The first argument is the player whose action is refused, and the rest are concatenated to form the message that you see.
2

2
You can override this verb if you want more selective refusal reporting. If you're refusing pages, for example, you might find that the refusal report is just as annoying as the original page--but you still don't want to turn it off. In that case, you might decide to give no more than one refusal report per minute, using code like this:
2

2
    @property me.refusal_time 0
2
    @property me.refusal_count 0
2
    @verb me:report_refusal this none this
2

The property that remembers whether refusal reporting is turned on is .report_refusal, which may have the values 0 or 1. The property is owned by Frand, so you can't change it directly.

 - refusal synonyms
2

2
You can give a refusal more than one name by overriding the verb :translate_refusal_synonym. The verb takes one argument, a word from the command line, and it returns a list of refusal names that the word stands for. If the word is not a synonym, :translate_refusal_synonym should return the empty list, {}.
2

2
    :translate_refusal_synonym (<word>) -> <list>
2

2
If you want 'noise' to mean both page and whisper for you, then you'd write this. You need to pass(@args) to get the synonym 'all', which stands for all refusable actions. If you type '@refuse noises from Munchkin', the plural 's' is removed automatically, so you don't have to worry about that.
2

2
    @verb me:translate_refusal_synonym this none this
2
    @program me:translate_refusal_synonym
2
      return pass(@args) ||
2
             (args [1] == "noise") ? {"page", "whisper"} | {};

HTTP Server
2
-----------

2
To use this device, all you need to do is put a .html property on your object. It will then serve a web page at http://SITE:PORT/OBJID where OBJID is the object's ID number without the # sign, SITE is your MOO's address, and PORT is your MOO's port.
2
If it starts with the line <HTML>, the server will automatically serve it up as HTML code.
2
Otherwise, you will need to use your own HTTP headers (for example, if you want to serve plain text instead of HTML).
2

2
If you want to have more functionality than this, you can make a verb :html(args), that does the same thing. The args are a list of anything after the OBJID divided by /.
2
For example, the URL http://SITE:PORT/123/foo/10 will result in a call to #123:html("foo","10"). This call should return a list of strings that is HTML, or HTTP stuff with the appropriate headers.
2

2
Additionally, your object can call http:tell_key(player). This will generate a special keyed URL for that player, so when your :html() verb is called, the built-in variable PLAYER will be set to the person who was issued the key.
2
This verb tells the player their custom key directly.

Fixed an issue in $ansi_pc:notify where it would terminate_normal even if the task was in the noansi queue, resulting in lines with visible ANSI tags gaining a [normal[null]] tag at the end.
2
Made @dump add the task to the noansi queue, allowing ANSI tags to be visible.
2
Added a call to 'remove_noansi' to @list to cleanup the noansi queue property.

Updated all the documentation. Fixed up $ansi_pc:@ansi-setup. Fixed up $ansi_utils:notify to be a *much* faster. Changed the format of $ansi_utils.ansi_log and made $ansi_help:ansi_log do the formatting itself. Added $ansi_utils:tell, $ansi_pc:title, $ansi_utils:ansi_title, help ansi-cutoff, $ansi_pc:confunc, $ansi_utils:quote_ansi, $ansi_utils.status_message, $ansi_pc:@ansi-status, help @ansi-status, $ansi_utils:trusts, $ansi_utils.trusted, $ansi_utils:setadd, $ansi_utils:setremove, $ansi_utils:terminate_normal, $ansi_utils:self_diagnostic, and a benchmark test. Fixed a bug in $ansi_utils:replace_group where it was ignoring @ansi-o escape. Removed $ansi_utils:maybe_restart_noansi and replaced it with the less server intensive :cleanup_noansi. Moved the main part of $ansi_utils:cutoff into an internal verb, :cutoff_locs, and made a :cutoff_assign verb that also uses it. Removed $ansi_utils:replace_group and :reset_string and moved it to :notify. Got rid of $ansi_utils.su_<whatever> and moved them to regular verbs on $ansi_utils. Fixed up $ansi_pc:linesplit to use $ansi_utils:cutoff_locs. Renamed $ansi_utils:update_regexp to update_all and made it update all the caches. Moved @ansi-setup to $ansi_utils.
2
NOTE: $ansi_utils:notify doesn't terminate all strings with a [[null]normal] code anymore, you will have to run the string through $ansi_utils:terminate_normal before calling it.
2
The home of the ANSI system is now NestMOO, instead of EnigMOO.

Updated all the documentation, removed $ansi_utils.test_title, added $ansi_pc:set_aliases, added $ansi_pc:@more to fix the one on $player, fixed up @ansi-setup a lot. I'm fairly confident that the ANSI system is now safe and secure.

Made $ansi_utils:notify, moved all the replacing stuff there, and hacked $ansi_pc:notify to call it instead of notify(). Moved the .noansi_queue, :add_noansi, and :remove_noansi from $ansi_pc to $ansi_utils. I also updated 'help ansi-bugs' now that I tracked down a couple of them.

Fixed some security problems that allowed players to get a copy of the escape character and use it for malicious purposes. To do that, I got rid of $ansi_pc:replace_ansi and put the code straight in :notify, which is able to pass() now. Also made an @ansi-setup verb for convenient porting, along with some core verb code on $ansi_utils. Fixed randoms to substitute faster by adding .random_colors. Added $ansi_utils:show_who_listing and changed @who to use it.

In Dark_Owl's absence, I fixed up a lot of code to make it take less ticks, due to the recent lag problems on EnigMOO, which we suspect were called by color codes (most noticeably s). Average :notify call with colors takes around 200 less ticks. Also updated much of the documentation, since I know DO doesn't like to do it ;) Copied the part of $player:set_name that checked whether people had color codes in their name or not to the ANSI PC.

$emu disappears and is replaced with $ansi_utils. $ansi_pc, $ansi_help, $ansi_options, are created and everything on $player is moved to $ansi_pc. @ansi is replaced by @ansi-o.

You can customize the way the ANSI Player Class works with the @ansi-options
2
command.  The format of this command is:
2

2
@ansi-option                         shows the ansi options
2
@ansi-option <option> [is] <value>   sets <option> to <value>
2
@ansi-option <option>=<value>        sets <option> to <value>
2
@ansi-option +<option>               sets <option>
2
@ansi-option -<option>               resets <option> (equiv. to <option>=0)
2
@ansi-option !<option>               resets <option> (equiv. to <option>=0)
2
@ansi-option <option>                displays value of <option>
2

2
The ansi options available at this time are:
2

2
 [bold][green]colors[normal]        This option specifies whether the MOO will display
2
               color sequences (such as [[null]blue] and [[null]red]).
2

2
 [bold][green]backgrounds[normal]   This option specifies whether the MOO will display
2
               background color sequences (such as [[null]b:blue] and [[null]b:red]).
2
	       Normal color, 256 color, and True Color all support background tags.
2
	       e.g. [[null]b:red]  [[null]b::200]  [[null]b:123:23:123]
2
	       
2
 [bold][green]blinking[normal]      This option specifies whether the MOO will allow things to
2
               blink on and off.  Most people find this annoying so they
2
               keep this off most of the time.
2

2
 [bold][green]bold[normal]          This option specifies whether the MOO will allow bright
2
               colors.  This probably isn't very useful unless you happen to
2
               have a hangover (maybe from a MOO bash, right Chapman ;) and
2
               the bright colors are hurting your eyes or something.
2
               (Or unless you're using a stupid windoze client that
2
                bolds as cyan.. gimme the name of a good freeware one
2
                and I'll be happy.. -Grant)
2

2
 [bold][green]misc[normal]          This option specifies whether the MOO should display all the
2
               ANSI codes not covered by the ones above.  This should usually
2
               be on if any of the above ones are on and will probably cause
2
               some very strange effects if it's not.
2

2
 [bold][green]extra[normal]         This option specifies whether the MOO will send certain
2
               non-printable characters.  So far, this option only includes
2
               beeps.  NOTE: these will probably work even if your terminal
2
               is not ANSI compatable.
2

2
 [bold][green]all[normal]           This turns on all of the above options.  Equivalent to
2
               '@ansi-options -none' except that it automatically does an
2
               '@ansi-options -ignore'.
2

2
 [bold][green]none[normal]          This turns off all of the above options.  Equivalent to
2
               @ansi-options -all
2

2
 [bold][green]escape[normal]        This option specifies what character the MOO will send for
2
               an escape character.  The default is an ASCII character 27
2
               but it can be set to another string in case control characters
2
               won't get through to your terminal (like say if you are
2
               multimooing from another MOO or something, see 'help
2
               ansi-multimooing' for more information on that.)
2

2
 [bold][green]ignore[normal]        This option overrides all the other options and tells the
2
               MOO to completely ignore any ANSI codes.  This means that you
2
               will see the actual codes (like [[null]blue] or [[null]normal]) instead
2
               of having them either translated or stripped out like normal.
2
               This will probably screw up the line wrapping, text centering
2
               and a bunch of other things and will probably be very spammy
2
               but it's useful for checking the value of properties and
2
               other things.
2

2
 [bold][green]no_connect_status[normal] This option specifies whether the ANSI status message
2
               will be displayed when you log on.
2

2
 [bold][green]truecolor[normal]    This option enables 24-bit True Color support. Your client
2
              must offer support for it. 
2
              Color sequences are in the form [[red]red[normal]:[green]green[normal]:[blue]blue[normal]]
2

2
 [bold][green]256[normal]          This option enables Xterm 256 color support. Your client must
2
              support it.
2
              Color sequences are in the form [:number]. e.g. [:200[null]]

The ANSI Player Class works by either translating codes into the ANSI sequences for them, or by stripping them out before sending the rest of the text to the player. An ANSI code is made up of the name of the code with a pair of brackets ([]'s) around it. Note to put codes into the documentation, they had to be put with a [[null]null] in between the letters, so something like [[[null]null]green] had to be written (and to make that.. sigh)
2

2
These codes can be used in almost anything. MOOmail, messages, names, descriptions, and pages are all good places to put codes. ANSI codes are *not* allowed in player's names though because of all the problems this might cause. You can, however, use the new @ansi-title verb to put codes in your name.
2

2
The codes are separated into 6 main groups:
2

2
 [bold][yellow]colors[normal]         Codes that change the text to another color.  These include:
2
                [[null]red], [[null]green], [[null]yellow], [[null]blue], [[null]purple], [[null]cyan],
2
                [[null]gray], and [[null]white].  You can also use [[null]magenta] instead
2
                of [[null]purple] and [[null]grey] instead of [[null]gray] but this isn't
2
                recommended.  NOTE: [[null]gray] implies a [[null]bold] so if you have:
2
                [[null]gray]This is gray.  [[null]red]This is red.[[null]normal]
2
                The 'This is red.' will be bright red, you must put an
2
                [[null]unbold] in front of it if you want it to be dark red.
2
                In addition, if your client supports 24-bit True Color and you've enabled the 'truecolor'
2
                option, you can create tags from any arbitrary combination of red, green, and blue values.
2
                e.g. [[null]255:255:153] to create the funky banana color.
2
                These can be turned off with '@ansi-options -colors' and '@ansi-options -truecolor'
2
 
2
 [bold][yellow]backgrounds[normal]    Codes that change the background of text to another color.
2
                The same color codes that can be used for normal colors also apply to background.
2
                To use backgrounds, simply add "b:" before your color name. For example:
2
                [[null]b:red] or [b:255:255:153[null]]
2
                Backgrounds can be turned off with '@ansi-options -backgrounds'
2

2
 [bold][yellow]bold[normal]           Codes that make the text bright or not bright.  These include:
2
                [[null]bold] and [[null]unbold].  You can also use [[null]bright] and
2
                [[null]unbright] but, again, this is not recommended.  These can be
2
                turned off with '@ansi-options -bold'.  This can be used to make
2
                bright colors by putting a [[null]bold] in front of the color.
2
                (for example, in: [[null]green]A[[null]bold]B[[null]red]C[[null]unbold]D[[null]normal]
2
                the A would be dark green, the B would be bright green, the C
2
                would be bright red, and the D would be dark red)
2

2
[bold][yellow]blinking[normal]       Codes that turn on and off the blinking.  These include:
2
                [[null]blink] and [[null]unblink].  They can be turned off with
2
                '@ansi-options -blinking'.
2

2
 [bold][yellow]misc.[normal]          All the codes not covered by the ones above.  These include:
2
                [[null]underline] and [[null]inverse].  NOTE: [[null]underline]
2
                does not actually underline text on most computers.  These can
2
                be turned off with '@ansi-options -misc'.
2

2
[bold][yellow]extra[normal]          Codes that are not really ANSI and may work even if your
2
                terminal is not ANSI compatable .  These include:
2
                [[null]beep].  It can be turned off with '@ansi-options -extra'.

2
For those of you that are multimooing from another MOO (probably using Sunwiz's excellent MultiMOO PC) and your escape characters are getting stripped out, you can tell the MOO to send a certain string instead of an ASCII character 27 by typing:  '@ansi-options escape <string>'. You will then have to set your terminal program to translate <string> into an escape character. I would suggest setting <string> to '~' or some other character that is very rarely used.  You probably shouldn't tell anyone what character you are using though, because then they can clear your screen, reposition your cursor, and some other annoying things. To tell the MOO to start sending character 27's for the escape characters again, type '@ansi-options -escape'. 
2

2
Other MOOs that have the ANSI PC or other color capability have their own method of transmitting colors, so you should probably set '@ansi-options +ignore' on all the MOOs except the one you are actually telnetting too, this is because inter-MOO connecting can't send escape characters, only ASCII text.

This ANSI system was written and designed by Don Schwarz <darkowl@mcs.net> aka Dark_Owl.  It is composed of an ANSI Player Class ($ansi_pc), an ANSI utility package ($ansi_utils), an ANSI help database ($ansi_help), and an ANSI option database ($ansi_options).
2
It converts ANSI 'codes', which are composed of a word surrounded by brackets ([]'s), into ANSI sequences which are recognized by most terminal programs and are used to display text in certain colors, underlined, inverse, and to make text blink.  Not all terminal programs support ANSI though so this will not work for everyone.
2

2
You can put these ANSI codes in your descriptions, messages, mails, programs, and virtually anything else that is eventually sent through $player:notify().  See 'help ansi-codes' for a list of valid ANSI codes.
2

2
The ANSI PC is controlled with the @ansi-options command, see 'help @ansi-options' for more information on it.

[bold][red]KNOWN BUGS:[normal]
2
  [bold][blue]1)[normal] Some terminal programs seem to act strangely with lines that start with a [[null]bold] code.  I'm pretty sure this isn't a MOO problem so I can't do anything about it.  I'd recommend always putting [[null]bold] codes *after* color codes, or if you're using TinyFugue, try typing "/set emulation raw".
2
  [bold][blue]2)[normal] You can still write in black with [[null]gray][[null]unbold].  Not a major problem, but it bugs me.
2
  [bold][blue]3)[normal] Some terminal programs seem to beep not only when they get a character 7, but also on every escape character they receive on the same line.
2
  [bold][blue]4)[normal] There's no way to set random replacements with @ansi-title.

2
There are a few verbs and properties that programmers might need to know about when programming things that interface with the ANSI system.  Some of the more useful ones include:
2

2
  $ansi_pc:ansi_option (STR option) - returns player's setting for <option>
2
  $ansi_pc:set_ansi_option (LIST    - sets player's options
2
                        options)
2
  $ansi_utils:add_noansi ()         - any text sent from the current task
2
                                      will not be translated by the ANSI PC.
2
  $ansi_utils:remove_noansi ()      - undoes a call to :add_noansi, this
2
                                      is not usually necessary because it
2
                                      gets removed from the queue when the
2
                                      task ends anyway.
2
  $ansi_utils.noansi_queue          - list of tasks that are currently
2
                                      being ignored.
2
  $ansi_utils:contains_codes (STR text) returns true if <text> contains
2
                                      any ANSI codes.
2
  $ansi_utils:delete (STR text)     - returns <text> with all the ANSI
2
                                      codes stripped.
2
  $ansi_utils:length (STR text)     - returns the length of <text> not
2
                                      including the ANSI codes.
2
  $ansi_utils:index/rindex (STR     - same as the builtins index() and
2
       text, STR text2[, NUM case]    rindex() but ignore ANSI codes.
2
  $ansi_utils:cutoff (STR text, NUM - same as text[start..end] for strings
2
       start, NUM end)                but ignores ANSI codes.
2
  $ansi_utils:cutoff_assign (STR    - same as text[start..end] = replacement
2
       text, NUM start, NUM end, STR
2
       replacement)
2
  $ansi_utils:notify (OBJ plr, STR  - Same as raw notify() but replaces
2

If you are starting a new MOO and wish to have ANSI on it, the easiest
2
  way is to use the ANSICore.  The ANSICore is a copy of the December
2
  25, 1995 LambdaCore in which everything has been fixed to work
2
  correctly with the ANSI.  The escape and beep characters are already
2
  present in the database so no set up or installation is necessary.
2
  The latest ANSICore is available via anonymous FTP from
2
  ftp.mcs.net in the directory /mcsnet.users/darkowl/ANSI, in a
2
  file named ANSICore.db.gz. (Sorry, due to file quotas I was unable to
2
  include the uncompressed version, but it is still available from
2
  darkowl.pr.mcs.net in the directory /pub/ANSI)
2
  NOTE: While the ANSI system is activated in the core, all players
2
    start out with the ANSI defaulting to off, so you will have to type
2
    '@ansi-options +all' before you can see any color.
2

2
To install the ANSI system on an already existing MOO, you will need the
2
  installation script.  This file should be uploaded into the MOO as a
2
  non-wizard (usually the second character of the wizard installing the
2
  ANSI) and will port the objects and give you instructions on how to
2
  start up the automatic setup program.  The latest installation script
2
  is available via anonymous FTP from ftp.mcs.net in the directory
2
  /mcsnet.users/darkowl/ANSI, in a file named ANSI.moo.

dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit
98
5
4
61
2
A very simple local editing protocol.
2

2
S->C #$#dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit-content (reference, name, type, content*)
2

2
Reference is the tag used when sending back to the server.
2
User may be allowed to edit it (i.e., save this same text into a
2
different property), with possibility of disastrous results.
2

2
Name is a human-readable name for the info, suitable for window title,
2
buffer name, etc.
2

2
Type is one of the following (for version 1.0):
2
 * string
2
 * string-list
2
 * moo-code
2

2
Content is the content interpreted according to the type
2
info given.  It's multiline (hence the *).
2

2
clients that don't provide special support for moo-code editing can
2
treat moo-code identically to string-list.
2

2
C->S #$#dns-org-mud-moo-simpleedit-set (reference, content*, type)
2

2
reference, content, and type are as above.  This is the message sent by the client to set when the user 'saves' the value.  Note this does not necessarily save the value.  Errors such as lack of permission to set the given reference or moo-code compliation errors may prevent it.  It is expected that the server will tell the user this (in the in-band text stream).  
2

2
Clients will probably want to provide a way to just send without closing the window, buffer, etc for this reason.
2

2

2
JHCore implementation notes
2

2
JHCore currently understands several different kinds of (local) editing sessions:
2
handled by $verb_editor:
2
   * verb editing
2
handled by $note_editor:
2
   * list of strings editing for notes and properties
2
handled by both $note_editor and $list_editor(?):
2
   * value editing for properties
2
handled by $mail_editor:
2
   * sending a mail message
2

2
@edit uses a semi-complicated system to determine (a) what the user is trying to edit and (b) how to edit it.   
2

2
So it looks like the critical things to modify are $generic_editor:invoke_local_editor, $note_editor:local_editing_info, $verb_editor:local_editing_info, and $mail_editor:local_editing_info.  
2

2
The current return path for locally edited stuff (in the core) appears to be:
2
  @program
2
  @set-note-text
2
  @set-note-value
2
  @@sendmail
2

2
.v_filter_in / .v_filter_out are hooks called when receiving/sending verb code.  JHCore supports a '// comment' syntax in verbs and conversion is made from '// blah' to '"blah";' by using the verbs :verbcode_external_to_internal / :verbcode_internal_to_external.
2

2
.v_filter_in / .v_filter_out are both 2 element lists containing an object id and a verb.  the JHCore configuration is:
2

2
    this.v_filter_in = { this, "verbcode_external_to_internal" }
2
    this.v_filter_out = { this, "verbcode_internal_to_external" }
2

2
Non JHCore installations might choose to set .v_filter_in / .v_filter_out to false (0, "" or {}) which leaves code lines unfiltered.

Rewritten from `help mcp-spec' June 7, 1994 by Jay Carlson.  Comments solicited; send mail to the `@proj usability client MCP' mailing list, moo-cows, or private email to j@io.com.
2

2
The MOO Client Protocol is a standard for transmitting structured "requests" between MUD clients and servers.  The original specification is available as `help mcp-spec', but the skeleton of a rewrite is here:
2

2
mcp-goals -- History and goals of the MCP protocol
2
mcp-syntax -- Syntactic description of MCP requests
2
mcp-semantics -- Semantics of MCP requests
2
mcp-requests -- Documented request types

MCP authentication
2
1=================
2

2
When an MCP client connects to an MCP server, it may set an `authentication key' for the duration of the connection.  The key is simply a string (in the format described in `help mcp-syntax') that must be sent by the server with every MCP request for the request to be authenticated.  The authentication key is a secret shared by the client and the MCP subsystem of the server.
2

2
The syntax for setting the authentication key is:
2

2
  #$#authentication-key <auth-key>
2
 
2

2
Clients may accept, reject, or query the user about MCP requests that are either missing an authentication key or have the incorrect key.
2

2
Typically, clients will generate a random number or string on connection and use it as their key.
2

2
Proposal: eliminate reference to client and server, and make the authentication scheme symmetric.

MCP display-url request
2
1======================
2

2
This is a simplification of the display-url request specification used by AstroVR.  It is intended to represent baseline functionality that most clients can implement.
2

2
display-url presents a document specified by a URL to the user.
2

2
Keywords
2
2=======
2

2
url:
2
3===
2

2
Required.  Must be an absolute URL, starting with a name scheme (such as "http:").
2

2
Example
2
2======
2

2
Present the JHM home page:
2

2
  #$#display-url 12345678 url: "http://jhm.ccs.neu.edu:7043/"

MCP edit* requests
2
1=================
2

2
A multi-line request for the client to invoke a local editor on the attached text, and later send the edited text to the server.
2

2
Keywords
2
2=======
2

2
type:
2
3====
2

2
Optional.  Suggested values include program, text, string, value and mail.  The client may be able to use this information to provide a specialized editing mode.
2

2
name:
2
3====
2

2
Optional.  A human-readable descriptive name for what's being edited.
2

2
In existing Emacs clients, this is used for the buffer name.  In tkmoo, name: is used as the window and icon title for the workspace editing the text.
2

2
upload:
2
3======
2

2
Required.  Specifies a line to prefix the edited text with before sending to the server.  When the text is sent to the server, it is followed by a line of a single period.
2

2
Notes
2
2====
2

2
Typically the upload: value will be a command that starts reading input from the player, like @paste or @qsend; the MOO will use $command_utils:read_lines() to consume the uploaded lines.
2

2
Proposal: Every known use of #$#edit requires "." as its final line sent back to the server.  Worse, it's not defined that dot-quoting should be performed on the uploaded text, which $command_utils:read_lines() expects.  We should either explicitly state these things, or we should use multi-line MCP requests to send the text back to the server.
2

2
Examples
2
2=======
2

2
A request to provide an editing session for a property:
2

2
  #$#edit* 12345678 type: text name: Dave.test upload: "@set-note-text #75.test"
2
  @@@This is a test.
2
  @@@
2
  #$#END
2

2
A request to provide an editing session for a verb:
2

2
  #$#edit* 12345678 type: program name: Dave:test upload: "@program #75:test none none none"
2
  @@@player:tell("This is a test.");
2
  #$#END

MCP ftp request
2
1==============
2

2
I don't understand the semantics of the ftp request fully.  AstroVR uses this protocol to move remote files into users' directories.
2

2
This specification does not specify whether anonymous ftp or authenticated ftp is used.
2

2
Keywords
2
2=======
2

2
host:
2
3====
2

2
Required.  Name of the FTP host containing the document.
2

2

2
3=========
2

2
Required.  The directory containing the document.
2

2
file:
2
3====
2

2
Required.  The filename of the document.
2

2
type:
2
3====
2

2
Required.  File type of the document.  Possible values are "ascii", "binary", "fits", "plaintext", "postscript", "compressed", and "tar".
2

2

2
Required.  Directory on the local machine the document is to be placed in.

2

2
  #$#ftp 12345678 host: ipac.caltech.edu directory: /pub/deposit file: mud.el.Z type: "compressed ascii" destination: clients/mud.el.Z

MCP goals
2
1========
2

2
Most MUD clients and servers communicate by an informal protocol: lines of printable ASCII characters separated by newlines.  This is closely related to the TELNET protocol, which will in fact interoperate with MUD servers.  But TELNET clients don't provide user interface support for even the simplest of MUD tasks.  Specialized MUD clients provided these tools.
2

2
Once people started to use clients, several realized that intelligence and user interface closer to the user could be exploited by the MUD.  
2

2
In particular, the LambdaCore editor system allows an option to ship whole documents (to a mud.el variant) to be edited locally, then returned.  The $gopher system can direct clients to fetch Gopher text directly (presenting a better UI and avoiding funneling texts through the MOO).
2

2
Such "requests" are out of band; that is, they can occur at any point in the interaction between client and server.  In particular, client requests may occur while a MOO is using the read() primitive.  The MOO server has a compile-time option to process lines starting with a given prefix as if they were truly out of band.
2

2
MCP is a simple protocol for transmitting structured messages between client and server.  It traffics in "requests", which have types, properties, and optional multi-line extensions.  Standard requests exist for local editing, URL display and gopher access.

MCP gopher request

The original MOO $gopher system used a private protocol.  This is a rendering of it into MCP.  It has become deprecated in favor of display-url.
2

2
Required.  Name of the gopher host to connect to.

3====
2

2
Optional.  Port number to connect to on gopher host; defaults to 70.
2

2

2

2
Optional.  Pathname to send to the gopher host.  Defaults to the empty string.
2

2

Example
2
2======
2

A request to retrive Gustavus Adolphus College's root menu:
2

2
  #$#gopher 12345678 host: gopher.gac.edu description: "1Gustavus Adolphus College"

MCP requests
2
1===========
2

2
There are several standard MCP request types.  If clients provide functionality similar to those described below, they should implement the MCP request as documented.
2

2
mcp-edit -- Perform local editing on a text
2
mcp-gopher -- Display a gopher text to the user
2
mcp-ftp -- Use ftp to download a file to the user's machine
2
mcp-display-url -- Display a URL to the user

MCP request semantics
2
1====================
2

2
An MCP request is of the general form:
2

2
  #$#<request-name>[*][ <auth-key>][ <keyword>: <value>]...
2
 
2

2
<request-name> identifies the `type' of the request.  The type of the request can be thought of as a function that processes the structures in the rest of the line.
2

2
<auth-key> is an optional authentication key.  See `help mcp-authentication'.
2

2
The set of <keyword>: <value> pairs are a function mapping <keyword>s onto <value>s.  <keyword>s are names of arguments to the request; <value>s are the corresponding values of arguments.
2

2
Duplicate <keyword>s are not allowed.  Arbitrary order of <keyword>: <value> pairs is allowed.
2

2
Specific <keyword>s may be optional for a given request type, with default <value>s assumed.
2

2
<keyword>s may be unrecognized by a request type.  A suggested strategy for request handlers is to ignore any <keyword>s they don't understand.

2
AUTHENTICATION
2
--------------
2

2
An authentication key is generated and uploaded by the client to the server at login.  Proposed method:
2

2
  #$#authentication-key <key>
2
 
2

2
This requires that the server be compiled with OUT_OF_BAND_PREFIX set to "#$#".  (It's actually possible to do it as a verb on $player, but many MOOs have a programmer command "#" which does something very different.)  The authentication key may not contain spaces, double-quotes, colons, or backslashes.
2

2
GENERAL RULES
2
-------------
2

2
String sent by server:
2

2
  #$#<request-name><*-if-data-follows> [<auth-key>] <keyword>: <value> ...
2
 
2

2
An identifying tag #$# is placed at the beginning of the request line.
2

2
  o  <request-name> is the type of request, e.g. "edit" or "ftp".
2
  o  <request-name> cannot contain spaces, double-quotes, backslashes, or asterisks.
2
  o  <*-if-data-follows> is either "*" if this request is followed by additional lines of data, or the empty string.
2
  o  <keyword> is the name of an argument to the request.  Keywords cannot contain spaces, double-quotes, colons, or backslashes.
2
  o  <value> is the value of the corresponding argument.  A <value> can contain any printing ASCII character (including space), but must be quoted in the standard MOO style (with double quotes, using backslash to escape quotes and backslashes) if it either contains spaces or is the empty string.  Arbitrary order of keyword: value pairs is allowed.
2

2
Keyword: value pairs may be optional.  We haven't discussed what clients should do with unrecognized keywords; my plan is for the client simply to ignore them and work with the keywords it recognizes.
2

2
REQUEST DEFINITIONS
2
-------------------
2

2
edit
2
====
2

2
type: <program|text|string|value|mail|...>
2

2
Type of information.  Clients may or may not be able to use a special editing mode depending on type.
2

2
name: <name>
2

2
User-friendly indication of what's in this.  Good for buffer name.
2

2
upload: <command>
2

2
Command to use to begin upload of this text.
2

2
ftp
2
===
2

2

2

2
Name of the host that has the document.
2

2
directory: <dir>
2

2
Name of the directory that the document is in.
2

2
file: <name>
2

2
Name of the file within the directory.
2

2
type: <type>
2

2
Type of document.  Current types include ($ftp.recognized_types):
2

2
      {"ascii", "binary", "fits", "plaintext", "postscript",
2
       "compressed", "tar"}
2

2
destination: <dir>
2

2
Place to store the document locally.  I don't fully understand this.
2

2
gopher

2

2
host: <name>
2

2
Name of the host to connect to.
2

2
port: <number>
2

2
Port to connect to.  Default is 70.
2

2
path: <string>
2

2
String to send to the gopher server.  Default is the empty string.
2

2
description:
2

2
Description string.  First character is the type character, rest of characters are human-readable name of object.  This seems unnecessarily arcane to me--why not separate these?
2

2
EXAMPLES
2
--------
2

2
A request to provide an editing session for a property.  The request is followed by lines of data, prepended with a special tag (@@@, unless someone has strong feelings about changing it), and marked at the end with another tag (#$#END, again subject to change).  The advantage of this over dot-quoting is that it should be fairly easy for the client to figure out if there's been some breakage on the server end and the transmission has terminated early.  (A line that doesn't start with @@@ and isn't #$#END should set off warning bells.)

2
  #$#edit* 12345678 type: text name: Dave.test upload: "@set-note-text #75.test"
2
  @@@This is a test.
2
  @@@
2
  #$#END
2

2
A request to provide an editing session for a verb.
2

2
  #$#edit* 12345678 type: program name: Dave:test upload: "@program #75:test none none none"
2
  @@@player:tell("This is a test.");
2
  #$#END
2

2
A request to upload a file from an anonymous ftp site.  The request line contains all the data necessary.
2

2
  #$#ftp 12345678 host: ipac.caltech.edu directory: /pub/deposit file: mud.el.Z type: "compressed ascii" destination: clients/mud.el.Z
2
 
2

2
A request to retrieve a document from a gopher server.
2

2
  #$#gopher 12345678 host: gopher.gac.edu description: "1Gustavus Adolphus College"
2
 
2

2
In this case, we take advantage of default values for the port: and path: arguments ("70" and "", respectively).

MCP request syntax
2
1=================
2

2
Input and output to and from client and server is presumed to be divided into records (called `lines' hereafter).
2

2
An MCP request is of the general form:
2

2
  #$#<request-name>[*][ <auth-key>][ <keyword>: <value>]...
2
 
2

2
"#$#" must be the first three characters in the line.
2

2
<request-name> is a string of one or more printable ASCII characters.  It may not contain spaces, double-quotes, backslashes or asterisks.
2

2
Proposal: require <request-name> to start with a letter.  This reserves a substantial part of the namespace for private out-of-band protocols, or other protocol extensions.
2

2
<auth-key> is a string of one or more printable ASCII characters.  It may not contain spaces, double-quotes, colons or backslashes.
2

2
<keyword> is a string of one or more printable ASCII characters.  It may not contain spaces, double-quotes, colons, or backslashes.
2

2
<value> is 
2

2
  o  a string of one or more printable ASCII characters not containing spaces, double-quotes or backslashes 
2
  o  OR is a string of zero or more printable ASCII characters, enclosed in double-quotes, with double-quotes and backslashes inside the string `quoted' by preceding them with a backslash.
2

2
Note that the empty string must be quoted.  Also, the ASCII TAB character is not allowed in <value>s, at all.
2

2
Proposal: disallow unquoted <value>s with colons in them.  This is not strictly necessary, but it could detect some bugs in MCP request generators.
2

2
If the asterisk after <request-name> is present, this line starts a `multi-line request'.  Zero or more lines of data associated with the request follow, prepended with "@@@".  These lines are terminated with a single line of the form "#$#END".
2

2
Note that the 1.7.7 LambdaMOO server cannot properly handle multi-line requests sent by a client if OUT_OF_BAND_PREFIX is defined as "#$#".
2

2
Proposal: multi-line requests, in their current form, should be deprecated in favor of some other construct providing this functionality.

A waif is a kind of datatype in the MOO programming language, akin to integers, floating point numbers, strings, lists, objects and errors.
2

2
Waifs are like objects in that they have inherited properties and verbs.  They are unlike objects in that they do not have object numbers, and do not ordinarily have a name, aliases, a location, or a description -- although they could.
2

2
For those who program in C, it may be helpful to think of a waif as being like the 'struct' datatype:  A waif is a collection of named values.  (A list is a collection of ordered values.)
2

2
Every waif inherits its properties and verbs from its 'class', which is an actual object that is a descendant of $waif.  Only properties and verbs whose names begin with a colon are inherited by the instantiated waif.  To create a waif, you invoke the verb <class>:new(), which returns the newly-minted waif as it's value.
2

2
A logical time to consider using waifs is in lieu of storing data as a list of lists.  Let's consider an example.  Suppose I want to create a bot that serves drinks and canapes, and for reasons of my own I want to specify what drinks are available rather than let some lout order a glass of diesel fuel at my tea party.  So I am going to create a list of drinks, the kind of container the drink comes in, and the number of sips in each, such that a cup of tea might have more sips (and thus take longer to drink) than a glass of sherry.
2

2
If I were to implement my drink list as a list of lists, I might do
2

2
  @prop bot.drink_options {{"tea", "cup", 10}, {"sherry", "glass", 4}, {"milk", "glass", 15}}
2

2
You can see that a glass of milk has more in it than a glass of sherry.  BUT, if you were looking at this code for the first time, you might not know that the third number in that list refers to quantity.  For longer sublists, it can get very confusing, indeed.
2

2
To implement this using waifs, you would first make an object, a kid of $waif, that you would use as a drink specification:
2

2
  @create $waif named "drink specification","dspec"
2

2
You would then own an object with the generic waif as its parent.  Next you would add properties to this object that the waifs are to inherit:
2

2
  @prop dspec.:drink_name "" rc
2
  @prop dspec.:drink_container "" rc
2
  @prop dspec.:sips_per_container 0 rc
2

2
Notice that each property name begins with a colon.  Property names that don't begin with a colon are not inherited by the waifs (.name, for example).
2

2
Since your drink specification is a kid of $waif, it inherits the verb :new that can be used to create a waif.  Here is how we would make a few:
2

2
  @prop bot.drink_options {} rc
2
  @prop bot.drink_spec <dspec> rc
2

2
  @verb bot:add_drink tnt rxd
2

2
  @program bot:add_drink
2
  "Adds a drink specification to this bot's .drink_options property.";
2
  "Maybe put in some code only to let the owner do this, but that is not germaine to this example.";
2
  {drink_name, drink_container, sips_per_container} = args;
2
  new_spec = this.drink_spec:new();
2
  new_spec.drink_name = drink_name;
2
  new_spec.drink_container = drink_container;
2
  new_spec.sips_per_container = sips_per_container;
2
  this.drink_options = {@this.drink_options, new_spec};
2
  "A robust version of this verb would check for proper data types in the args, maybe look for duplicates first, etc.";
2
  .
2

2
Later on you might want to specify a color for each drink, so that if it comes in a dribble glass, you can say what color the stain on your poor victim's tie is.  You would add the property (.:color -- remember the colon) to the drink spec object, and voila, it would exist on all the waifs.  You would need to set the individual values, of course, but you wouldn't have to do gymnastics on sublists in lists, which can be a delicate operation indeed.

The inline editor is a vastly improved version of the current prompt that accepts multiple lines. It allows for insert and delete operations, text pasting or auto-formatting, as well as spell checking and other functions. 
2

2
The editor is highly customizable. To change different aspects of editing, type EDIT-OPTIONS (or simply EDIT-O). For help on the different commands available to you while editing, you can use the HELP command inside the editor. This is accessible by typing your command character, which is a forward slash (/) by default, followed by the word HELP.
